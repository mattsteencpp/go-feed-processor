Tomorrow we can all make our resolutions for the year ahead to be better individuals and to help make the world a better place (and eat fewer peanut M&amp;Ms).</p> <p>Football clubs don&#8217;t make resolutions though, but they have to make decisions and Arsenal have a big one to make about Mesut Ozil. Whether the knee injury he&#8217;s reportedly out with is actually knee injury or a bruised ego or something else, what&#8217;s clear is that there&#8217;s an ongoing issue between the German and Unai Emery. We have a situation where our highest profile player and highest paid player doesn&#8217;t get picked for games away from home anymore.</p> <p>Bournemouth are too physical – and they are statistically the least physical team in the Premier League. He was on the bench at Southampton and dreadful when he came on. Taken off at half-time against Brighton. And of course he didn&#8217;t feature in the 5-1 demolition at Anfield because of the knee injury he complained off after training. We&#8217;re reaching a point where this is becoming unsustainable because, quite frankly, you can&#8217;t have a bit-part player on £350,000 a week. Not only that, because of Ozil&#8217;s fame and reputation, it&#8217;s not as if his absence will be overlooked or not cause ripples. Every time he&#8217;s out it&#8217;s a big story, and each subsequent absence causes further ripples and adds weight to it all.</p> <p>Does Emery simply not trust him? Has there been a falling out? Is it a case that the manager won&#8217;t allow a star player to derail the dressing room because he wants or expects special treatment? Is it simply tactical, as Emery keeps insisting? I wish I knew, but whatever the reason or reasons behind it, Arsenal have got a problem they need to deal with one way or the other.</p> <p>Either find a way to integrate Ozil into the team, and harness the talent and creativity we all know he has on a consistent basis, or bite the bullet and move him on. Both appear to be easier said than done, of course, but there doesn&#8217;t really seem to be any sensible in-between option. Can you really pay someone £18m a year to play some home games against opposition that might not test him too much physically? Of course not. It makes no sense on a footballing level and on a financial level it&#8217;s completely absurd.</p> <p>Ozil has a contract until 2021 which, if he sees it out, will see the club pay him £42,000,000. That&#8217;s a hell of a lot of money, and you could easily make the case it could be better spent based on what we&#8217;re getting for it right now. Let me also make it clear that Ozil&#8217;s salary is what Arsenal decided to give him to tempt him to stay, a long-lasting goodbye gift from Ivan Gazidis, so you if there&#8217;s anger about the money side of things it should be directed there. Every player is going to try and get the best possible deal for themselves, and Ozil and his agent played a blinder in that regard.</p> <p>Yet with that kind of salary comes a responsibility to produce on the football pitch, and bar the occasional game and odd moments when his quality is on show – the pass to Kolasinac the other week, for example – we haven&#8217;t had value for money. Now, with his stock falling faster than Wall Street in 1929, and his appearances in the team more and more fleeting, we appear even less likely to see it on a consistent basis.</p> <p>So, what to do? I know it sounds ludicrous to consider selling our most creative player when we&#8217;re a team that is lacking creativity in a big way, but he can&#8217;t create from the bench or his box at the Emirates. If there&#8217;s no hope of reconciliation here, or no way that Emery can bring him back into the team bar the odd selection here and there, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any other option but to try and sell. It&#8217;ll be tough because few clubs can afford to pay £350,000 a week but it&#8217;s not impossible. A golden handshake where he&#8217;s given a chunk of that potential £42m he&#8217;ll earn if he stays might be part of any potential deal, but it&#8217;ll still be difficult to do – particularly if the player isn&#8217;t that keen on leaving.</p> <p>I think Emery is making the point as clearly as he can to the powers that be that Ozil is not part of his long-term plans. If it&#8217;s an either/or scenario, the club have little choice but to back the manager, regardless of how unpopular the player&#8217;s departure might be seen to be. How they replace him, or reinvest the money it would free up could go a long way to applying salve to any burn, but maybe it&#8217;s a necessary step for the future.</p> <p>The legacy of the last few years is an imbalanced squad and terrible spending which is impacting us financially today. Massive transfer fees on players not worth half of what we paid for them; poor deals like Lucas Perez which cost the club £15m in transfer fees plus wages; overpaying Ozil because we were so desperate; overpaying Mkhitaryan who came in on £200,000 a week to replace a £130,000 a week Alexis Sanchez who, at least, contributed a lot in terms of goals and assists during the good times; seeing valuable players like Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck allowed to run their deals down and getting nothing from them when selling and reinvesting was by far the best option.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a lot for these new people in charge to deal with, along with the continued loss of Champions League revenue which, according to the new Managing Director, hits us to the tune of tens of millions every season. For a self-sustaining club that&#8217;s a lot of money, and it&#8217;s why getting back into the top four or winning the Europa League is so vital. We can&#8217;t afford to keep wasting cash, and a Mesut Ozil on that pay-packet who barely plays because the manager doesn&#8217;t fancy him is a waste of both money and talent and we can&#8217;t allow it to continue.</p> <p>I&#8217;m very curious to see what happens in January. I think it&#8217;s going to have to be busier than we expected, and probably busier than they wanted it to be, but circumstances change and you have to be able to react. Can we? Let&#8217;s see.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>Finally, just a moment to wish you all a very happy, peaceful and healthy new year. From all of us here at Arseblog, our sincere thanks for being with us throughout what has been a very busy and very eventful 2018.

And by sobering I mean a big bag of bollocks. Arsenal went to Anfield and came away humiliated by Jurgen Klopp&#8217;s side who looked like they could have scored every time they came forward. I know that&#8217;s a thing people say when they want to emphasise how poor a team was defensively, an exaggeration to hammer home the point, but last night it was the actual truth.</p> <p>From the very first whistle they looked dangerous and we looked petrified. Despite taking the lead through Ainsley Maitland-Niles far post finish from a fine Alex Iwobi cross – a goal well and truly against the run of play – our lack of quality at the back, coupled with a distinct lack of organisation throughout the side, immediately came back to haunt us.</p> <p>Liverpool equalised straight away. A last-ditch Xhaka tackle rebounded around our box like a hot potato, Lichtsteiner&#8217;s desperate attempt at a clearance cannoned back off Mustafi and into the path of Firmino who had the simple task of tapping home from close range. It was reminiscent of how we conceded so soon after scoring against Man Utd at Old Trafford, Keystone Cops defending, but then we got that second goal.</p> <p>Torreira lost the ball in midfield and what happened next would have been comical if it had been any other team, but the way Firmino went through to score was abject. Quite what Mustafi is doing is beyond me, but I know that at this point I&#8217;d be far happier if he was doing it for some other club. Of course he ended up on his arse, that&#8217;s what he does, and Sokratis wasn&#8217;t any better. He too defended like a hungover Sunday League player, Firminho slotted the ball past Leno and inside two minutes Liverpool had gone from being behind to ahead. To even attempt to call it defending would be a breach of the trades descriptions act. It was pathetic.</p> <p>After a careless back pass from Kolasinac gave Liverpool a corner, we cleared it, then stood around like a bunch of people in a train station trying to work out what the tannoy was saying. Lichtsteiner was hopeless and played Salah onside as a ball over the top found the Egyptian, Mustafi was Mustafi with no sense of where the danger was, Sokratis no better again, and a first time cross allowed Mane to make it 3-1 from close range. Shambles.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people raging at the referee after this game, but I really think he&#8217;s the wrong target for any ire this morning. Ask yourself this, if Aubameyang had got the wrong side of Lovren – who then had a couple of nibbles at his ankles in the box – and the striker went down would you expect a penalty? Of course you would. Is it soft? Sure, but you see them given all the time, and it was stupid defending from Sokratis more than anything else – and I don&#8217;t think Michael Oliver got that wrong based on the penalties we see awarded week in, week out.</p> <p>The second one was perhaps a bit softer, but again it was a barge in the back from Kolasinac who has a tendency to push, shove, grapple and be overly tactile in our penalty area. Why wouldn&#8217;t the opponent go down? An Arsenal player would, and should, do exactly the same in that situation. Lovren made the most of it, but don&#8217;t give him something to make the most of. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don&#8217;t, but Kolasinac has gotten away with a few this season, and yesterday he didn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t blame the referee, blame the bloke who barged his man in the back in full sight of the official.</p> <p>As for the one late on that we should have had, I agree it was a penalty, Clyne caught Lacazette but it took a super slow-motion replay to show the contact, and the fact that the striker took a step before going down obviously cast some doubt in the mind of the referee. It was 5-1 at that point though, and if we sit here and start blaming the referee we&#8217;re missing the target completely.</p> <p>If last night&#8217;s game wasn&#8217;t the final piece of cast-iron evidence required that this club has to invest in defenders who can actually defend as a matter of urgency, then I don&#8217;t know what is. Lichtsteiner is a busted flush, maybe a good dressing room influence and all that, but he doesn&#8217;t have the legs to play at this level. Mustafi doesn&#8217;t have the brain to play at this level, almost three seasons of watching this bloke skid, slide, stumble and bumble his way around the centre of our defence is more than enough. It feels like some kind of punishment for something we all did in a previous life. Something so egregious that this is our fate. I&#8217;ve had enough.</p> <p>Kolasinac is an asset going forward but remains defensively suspect. Koscielny and Monreal are coming towards the end of their careers, and Sokratis is new enough to escape for the moment but you look at that performance last night against a top team and you can&#8217;t help but have doubts. And we&#8217;re supposed to think that signing Gary Cahill on loan after his 21 minutes of Premier League football this season will sort things out? If that&#8217;s the best this lot can do then we should all be very worried.</p> <p>In many ways I feel for Unai Emery because you can&#8217;t make a silk purse from a sow&#8217;s ear and I just don&#8217;t think the personnel we have are anywhere near good enough to produce on a consistent basis. And this is key by the way. On a particular day we can see performances from these players which give you pause for thought. &#8216;Oooh maybe &#8230;&#8217;, you think but it&#8217;s about producing that level on a consistent basis and none of them can do that, so you&#8217;re always teetering on the brink of self-destruction. We&#8217;ve conceded 30 goals in 20 games, it&#8217;s nowhere near good enough.</p> <p>The manager needs better and the club have to source those players and bring them in, because the longer we persist with some of these guys the more difficult it&#8217;s going to be to achieve what we&#8217;d like us to achieve. I&#8217;ve said time and again that Emery needs time and transfer windows to sort out our problems, and I stand by that.</p> <p>At the same time though, he can&#8217;t escape a result like this without some measure of blame. Yes, our defenders are poor, but so too was our organisation. How easy is it to open us up time and time again? And it&#8217;s not just Liverpool last night, almost every team we&#8217;ve played this season has been able to fashion good chances against us, and that&#8217;s got to be something we can improve on from the training ground.</p> <p>Perhaps the tactical flexibility that we&#8217;ve enjoyed has come at the expense of having a defined system of play which is at the core of what we do. I still don&#8217;t know what that is under Emery, and I&#8217;m not sure the players do either. Look at Alex Iwobi coming on against Brighton the other night and asking a teammate what formation we were using. It&#8217;s easier to shift to something new when you know what the baseline is, and I don&#8217;t know that we have that set in stone just yet.</p> <p>I appreciate it&#8217;s been tough, we&#8217;ve had injuries that have had a real impact on what we can do. Losing Holding and Bellerin this month, probably our two best defenders this season, has been a significant blow, and the absence of Danny Welbeck has left us short of effective options in the final third. The ongoing Ozil situation is an unpleasant cloud over almost everything, and the coach has had to work hard to achieve results. All the same, as much as I would like to shoot some of our defenders into the sun, I think Emery should be able to instill a bit more structure and organisation into his team which would go some way to offsetting their lack of quality/brain cells.</p> <p>Will it spark the club into action in January? Your guess is as good as mine. Transfer funds are limited, the wage bill is over-inflated with players from whom we&#8217;re not getting sufficient end-product based on how much we&#8217;re paying them, and the market next month is difficult, we all appreciate that. But if the remit is for Emery to get this team into the Champions League and the club expect him to do that without players good enough to produce at this level then he&#8217;s basically pissing in the wind.</p> <p>It&#8217;s time for the people running the football side of things to step up, be decisive with certain players and situations, and improve the overall quality in the squad. If they don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll see days like this again – and defeats like this one are far more damaging than just the loss of points. They&#8217;re corrosive and debilitating on many levels, and last night&#8217;s result wasn&#8217;t just a defeat, it was a real setback.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>James and I will be recording an Arsecast Extra later today.

It&#8217;s a game which will demand much from Unai Emery and his players, and we need to be an awful lot better than we were at Brighton if we&#8217;re to come away with anything tangible.</p> <p>Defensively we still have issues, and I suspect we&#8217;ll see a back three tonight. My guess is that Laurent Koscielny&#8217;s withdrawal on 70 minutes the other night was to ensure he could play against the Mugsmashers, and it&#8217;ll likely be Sokratis and Lichtsteiner in there with him unless Mustafi is considered ready after his return to training. Sead Kolasinac is the obvious choice for the left, and on the right it&#8217;s between Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Carl Jenkinson. The former came on at the Amex and had a real stinker, so it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if Emery went with the latter. If it were me, I&#8217;d give Maitland-Niles the nod, he&#8217;s played well against Liverpool before and deserves a chance to show that his poor display was just an aberration.</p> <p>In midfield Torreira and Xhaka had the measure of their opponents in the 1-1 draw at the Emirates back in November and we&#8217;ll need something approaching that level of performance tonight. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is a player in good form who Liverpool will be worried about despite how good they are at the back, and then you have to imagine it&#8217;ll be a couple from Lacazette, Iwobi and Ramsey. I know there&#8217;s a contractual situation with the Welshman, but when you look at the teams he&#8217;s being linked with – PSG, Bayern Munich, Juventus – you have to question why we&#8217;re not using him.</p> <p>For me, you also have to question why, considering other situations at the club, we&#8217;re not rethinking the entire Ramsey thing, but in the very short term we have a good player who is not playing and a team which needs something different. I think he should start tonight, and I think he&#8217;ll give us 100% if he does, as well as some attacking threat which would be very useful for a side which needs that to balance its defensive instability.</p> <p>One man who won&#8217;t be playing though is Mesut Ozil. He is not in the squad having trained normally yesterday but then <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/mesut-ozil-out-of-liverpool-game-with-knee-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complained of a knee injury afterwards</a>. It could be a knee injury of course, but given everything that&#8217;s gone on with him this season it&#8217;s hard not to be cynical. Maybe it&#8217;s the kind of pain in your knee you feel when you want to avoid the ignominy of being benched or left out anyway, but what&#8217;s clear is that for one of our biggest games of the season our biggest star and highest earner won&#8217;t play.</p> <p>It&#8217;s easily forgotten that Ozil played the 90 minutes of this fixture last month, not particularly well or anything, but he played. However, away from home Emery just doesn&#8217;t seem to trust him, and it&#8217;s difficult not to think that this is a factor in today&#8217;s absence. It leaves us without nominally a true creative talent, but with just one Premier League assist to his name this season it&#8217;s not something we&#8217;ve seen enough of. People can argue the toss over this all day, whether it&#8217;s the player, whether it&#8217;s Emery, or a combination of the two, but when it comes right down to it, it&#8217;s becoming a truly unhealthy situation which is overshadowing more important things and needs to be sorted out one way or the other as soon as possible.</p> <p>Today we need to concentrate on the players who are in the squad and what we can get from them, and there&#8217;ll be plenty of time afterwards to discuss it. What Emery, the Head of Football Raul Sanllehi, and others do about it will be critical, because the longer this goes on the more toxic it becomes. There&#8217;s some real decisiveness required here, it cannot be allowed to fester.</p> <p>As for the game itself, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m feeling especially confident about this one after the way we&#8217;ve been playing recently. Their attacking prowess versus a team which wobbles defensively in a light breeze doesn&#8217;t necessarily augur well, but hopefully we can do enough to come away tonight with a point. If you offered it to me now, I&#8217;d take it, but football is funny and maybe it&#8217;ll be one those performances like Sp*rs or the previous Liverpool game in which we really turn up. Fingers crossed.</p> <p>As ever, you can follow the game on our <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a>, and we&#8217;ll have all the post-match stuff on <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arseblog News</a> afterwards.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>Finally for today, a word on the passing of former Chairman Peter Hill-Wood who has died at the age of 82. It brings to an end a long connection with Arsenal Football Club as his father was Chairman before him, and his grandfather before him again. I&#8217;m sure almost everyone knows the story about Anfield 89 at this point, but for those who don&#8217;t, when Michael Thomas burst through to score the winner in the dying seconds to win us the title, he turned to David Dein beside him in the director&#8217;s box, calm as you like, and uttered the phrase &#8216;Never in doubt&#8217;. A classic by any standards.</p> <p>He was a funny, witty man who perhaps rubbed some people up the wrong way from time to time, but that was also part of the charm. There was no doubt about his love of Arsenal, and he featured regularly on this blog. I remember back around 2004, when Arseblog had been going just a couple of years, getting an email from someone called Charlie Hill-Wood who had just moved to Barcelona. Being the ace detective that I am I put two and two together eventually, and we&#8217;d meet and watch games with Swedish Chris in the Philharmonic on c/Mallorca owned by the crotchety old lady and her husband.</p> <p>We stay in touch, and I remember those as really great times in my life, watching the best Arsenal team of my lifetime, living abroad, and PHW is inextricably linked to that. To Charlie, JJ, Sarah and all the Hill-Wood family and friends, my deepest condolences.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>Right, that&#8217;s it for this morning, catch you later on for the game.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&amp;linkname=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fliverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence%2F&#038;title=Liverpool%20preview%3A%20Gunners%20face%20a%20tough%20task%20as%20preparations%20are%20overshadowed%20by%20Ozil%E2%80%99s%20absence" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2018/12/liverpool-preview-gunners-face-a-tough-task-as-preparations-are-overshadowed-by-ozils-absence/" data-a2a-title="Liverpool preview: Gunners face a tough task as preparations are overshadowed by Ozil’s absence"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item>

A little over a year ago Liverpool manager <a href="https://arseblog.com/2017/12/can-even-celebrate-christmas-game-disrespected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jurgen Klopp shamed the game and ruined his own reputation</a> by throwing a bottle of water at the Emirates of all places; and apparently Jose Mourinho was also fined and banned for kicking a carafe of the finest H20 but I can&#8217;t remember this incident at all as I guess it&#8217;s just so far down the list of terrible things Mourinho has done [numbers 1-99 are all the same: existing].</p> <p>On Wednesday night, Emery, frustrated at something, kicked a bottle of water which someone had left lying around, it span off and hit a supporter. He immediately apologised, the supporter accepted that apology, and life went on. However, yesterday he was hit with FA&#8217;s own bottle of a water, <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/unai-emery-charged-with-improper-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a charge of improper conduct</a>. He could be banned, there&#8217;s precedent for it, but he might get away with a fine given he doesn&#8217;t have any track record of ill-discipline in England and has been known to give generously to charities which look after bottles of water which have been abused and treated badly. We&#8217;ll see what happens.</p> <p>Ahead of the Liverpool game, he noted the gap between us and them in the league right now, saying:</p> <blockquote><p>It is a big challenge and a good test to know who we are, the difference between them and us in the table is clear.</p></blockquote> <p>The big difference is, of course, in the goals against column – 25 for us, just 7 for Liverpool. In terms of goals scored we&#8217;re more or less the same, and you don&#8217;t need to be any kind of genius to work out that our big problem this season is at the back. Diving down into that though, another difference is that Liverpool are three years into the Jurgen Klopp era, and defensive improvement didn&#8217;t happen overnight.</p> <p>It took time, patience and investment. Liverpool were smart when it came to generating transfer funds, selling big name players like Luis Suarez and Philipe Coutinho for big fees, and then ploughing that money back into the squad. At Arsenal, we&#8217;ve allowed too many players to reach a point in their contracts where they can leave for free, leaving tens of millions behind on just Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck this season alone, and the inability to manage player contracts as well as we should have has left us with Mesut Ozil&#8217;s inflated £350,000 a week wage to deal with.</p> <p>We were in a situation where we negotiated from a position of no real strength, and that salary is now a burden – particularly as Emery doesn&#8217;t appear to trust the club&#8217;s top earner and biggest star to play the way he wants. His half-time removal at Brighton makes it very difficult to see him start tomorrow and raises more questions about his future with us, but the Spaniard <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/emery-refuses-to-be-drawn-on-ozils-anfield-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to be drawn on that particular issue yesterday</a>.</p> <p>He says he sees every player as the same, which I understand completely when you&#8217;re trying to build a harmonious squad in which everyone feels included. But the reality is that not every player is the same. Leaving Carl Jenkinson out of the team doesn&#8217;t have the same impact as leaving Mesut Ozil out of it, for all kinds of reasons I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t need to go into because they&#8217;re so blindingly obvious.</p> <p>Back to the original point though, and it now wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if we saw Arsenal try and sell some players in January to raise funds for transfers. If the door is fully closed on Ramsey then do a deal if possible and get something rather than nothing. I&#8217;d be very cautious about spending that something on Ever Banega, another player the wrong side of the 30, I&#8217;d rather we tried to source a defender which is far more important.</p> <p>And if the Ozil/Emery relationship is as toxic as it seems, then make a call there too. The difference between the Suarez/Coutinho situations is that there wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be the kind of suitor willing to pay a big fee, not least because the prospect of matching his Arsenal salary would be a difficult one (maybe we could get Arsene to have a quiet word with his mates at PSG). We&#8217;re not desperately trying to hang on to a player at the top of his game, we&#8217;d be willing sellers of a player whose reputation is on the wane, and that&#8217;s a weak hand to try and negotiate from.</p> <p>None of this is ideal of course, but it&#8217;s also a test for the people who are running the football side of things nowadays. In the past the accusation that we were slow to react to obvious problems was often accurate. Or that we didn&#8217;t address them properly – think of the winter when we were absolutely desperate for defensive recruitment, Wenger did nothing for the entire month of January and at the last minute signed Andrei Arshavin. Classic Arsene.</p> <p>Is this a new Arsenal now? When Raul and Vinai spoke about carrying on the traditions of this club, I hope they don&#8217;t mean those ones. We have a head coach who is far more reactive in games than the previous one. It has mostly worked for him, sometimes it hasn&#8217;t as we saw the other night, but generally people have been enthused by his willingness to change things quickly when he feels they&#8217;re not right.</p> <p>Are those qualities shared by the Head of Football and Head of Recruitment? They must be aware that the squad is in need of investment and that there&#8217;s a serious issue with a player whose wages could be spread out much more efficiently if made available by his departure. Ozil&#8217;s salary could pay for four or five Lucas Torreiras – if you could find them, of course, but that&#8217;s their job, not ours. As much as Emery has a big job to do, so do they – especially as in this new structure they&#8217;re basically responsible for how the squad is put together.</p> <p>They did their work in the summer, and for the most part they did well, but they got it wrong at right-back, and that&#8217;s an issue that needs to be addressed either via the market or the academy. We have to get a central defender in as soon as possible, and there&#8217;s something required in the final third too. It&#8217;s more business than they might like do at a time they&#8217;d prefer not to do it, and in many ways this is a hangover from the previous regime, but in match terms we&#8217;re 2-1 down at half-time and a team talk won&#8217;t be sufficient.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>For more on the Liverpool game and Liverpool themselves, there&#8217;s a sneaky new Arsecast for you in which I&#8217;m joined by my brother, The Mugsmasher, for some pre-game chat and a little bit of the usual waffle.

This despite sometimes being played on the left hand side of the attack and often being used as a substitute. Aubameyang has 22 goals in 31 appearances since joining a pretty wayward Arsenal side back in January.</p> <p>Thus far, he has been an unqualified success in North London and the Premier League more generally, hitting the ground running and finding the net at an outstanding rate right from the start. Yet his feats have been curiously under played. His two goals against Burnley recently won a tight game for the Gunners, yet his name was conspicuous by its absence from the back pages and the tongues and typewriters of the analysts.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let&#39;s just take a moment to appreciate <a href="https://twitter.com/Aubameyang7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Aubameyang7</a>&#39;s record in home <a href="https://twitter.com/premierleague?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@premierleague</a> games <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/BxO9KKxFHm">pic.twitter.com/BxO9KKxFHm</a></p> <p>&mdash; Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/1076719049323700224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Inside the stadium, his name was sung with an abbreviated enthusiasm, as though the supporters were fulfilling a contractual obligation to sing the goalscorer’s name. Prolific scorers rarely find credit difficult to come by, as Harry Kane’s recent OBE nomination attests. So why does Auba find rooftop acclaim so elusive?</p> <p>For a start, I think the same is true of Sergio Aguero, who is generally well respected in England, but his record really should put him in the conversation as one of the Premier League’s greatest imports but rarely seems to. Aubameyang and Aguero are analogous I think because they are both pure goal scorers. Both are technically perfectly competent, but don’t really stand out at anything other than finding good positions to score really close to the goal.</p> <p>Both rarely score screamers, most of their goals are scored in the final 15 yards of the pitch, central to the goal, so a lot of the finishes lack a ‘wow’ factor. The gift that both players share is realised off the ball and away from the prying eyes of defenders and, ergo, the public at large. Both players take a high volume of close range shots because they specialise in finding space. They could get away from a man marker in a phone booth.</p> <p>Aubameyang is a pure ‘poacher’ which, in itself, is often a pejoratively used term. (The modern version of its forefather, ‘goal hanger’). Historically, this type of forward has found commensurate respect difficult to come by. I recall Gary Lineker being teased as a goal hanger. Mention the name of Pipo Inzaghi and you will likely be met with a snort of mild derision. You may even recall Sir Alex Ferguson’s quip that he was ‘born offside.’</p> <p>Inzaghi is a three time Serie A winner and two time Champions League winner who holds the record for the most amount of hat tricks scored in Italy’s top flight (10). Even the likes of Jimmy Greaves and Gerd Muller probably aren’t held in the reverence that their records warrant historically. In recent years, the ‘poacher’ has probably lost even more cache with the football watching public.</p> <p>The generation of Thierry Henry, Raul, Ronaldo (Brazilian) and Andriy Shevchenko altered the perception of how a top class striker operates. Andy Cole played in more or less the same era as the aforementioned and people look upon him as a bit of a joke, despite playing a huge part in Manchester United winning 5 Premier League titles and a Champions League.</p> <p>There is a sincere tactical discussion about the ‘value’ of the poacher in top level football, which Michael Cox dissects brilliantly in his book ‘The Mixer.’ Alex Ferguson sold Ruud van Nistelrooy because the Dutchman’s desire for goals began to ‘swallow’ the other elements of the team. Van Nistelrooy only won 1 Premier League title at Old Trafford at the height of the club’s power and the club consistently failed in the Champions League during his tenure.</p> <p>Ferguson moved away from a single point of contact and built a front line out of the rotating triangle of Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez and won 3 consecutive league titles and a Champions League. Something similar happened to Arsenal with Ian Wright in truth. Wright signed when the Gunners were reigning champions and the club did not win a title again until Wright was largely injured and replaced by Anelka in 1997-98.</p> <p>Aubameyang doesn’t score screamers, he does not drop deep to link play. He stays advanced and looks to find a nook or a cranny in the penalty area. He is a low touch player, whose presence can completely escape your notice until he troubles the onion bag. He also doesn’t conform with the modern mould of an elite striker.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flips, funnies and fantastic finishing&#8230; it&#39;s the best of <a href="https://twitter.com/Aubameyang7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aubameyang7</a> in 2018 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f4ab.png" alt="💫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p> <p>If you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Auba, you&#39;ll <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> this<a href="https://t.co/ddUR5gsFjm">https://t.co/ddUR5gsFjm</a></p> <p>&mdash; Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/1076766360460349440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Centre forwards at the top level play more of a “9.5” role. Kane does it, he even eschewed the number 9 shirt at Spurs in favour of the number 10. Robin van Persie played in this manner too. Obviously Ronaldo and Messi have altered the pattern of the goal scorer by scoring many of their goals from nominally wide positions. The likes of Gareth Bale and Mo Salah have continued this mantle.</p> <p>As a result, centre forwards have often become butlers for free scoring inside forwards. Karin Benzema made a career as Cristiano Ronaldo’s butler, Roberto Firmino has provided a similar service for Mo Salah and Gabriel Jesus performs this role excellently for Neymar for Brazil. Aubameyang transitioned into a throwback striker after being an orthodox wide man charged with providing the bullets for Robert Lewandowski at Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>Much of this explains the relative silence around his Arsenal output more widely. But Arsenal fans have not showered him with the hero worship afforded to other prolific strikers. After a few years of (justifiably) wanting an upgrade on Olivier Giroud, you would think that Auba would be greeted like rainfall in the desert, but, while not disliked or anything close, he doesn’t seem to be as popular as the more hard running and therefore noticeable Alexandre Lacazette.</p> <p>My guess is that his lack of involvement in games explains a lot of this. But also, despite his inventive hairstyles and outlandish taste in clothes and cars, Aubameyang is not an especially interesting player. He is no one man fireworks factory like Ian Wright, he doesn’t have van Persie’s penchant for blistering volleys nor is he as obsessed with his running statistics as the Dutchman.</p> <p>He doesn’t have Henry’s insouciance or Vaudevillian sense of theatre, nor does he provide the visceral thrill Adebayor briefly provided with his relentless bullying of defenders. He lacks Olivier Giroud’s GQ looks (don’t we all?) Auba doesn’t even really have an ounce of devil in him on the field. When he came to the club, he immediately befriended the club’s expensively acquired number 9 – compare and contrast that to Nicolas Anelka’s thinly veiled hatred of Marc Overmars, or Jens Lehmann essentially bullying Manuel Almunia for daring to exist.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FriendshipGoals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FriendshipGoals</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/Aubameyang7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Aubameyang7</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/LacazetteAlex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LacazetteAlex</a> <a href="https://t.co/xa6Iga4SNt">pic.twitter.com/xa6Iga4SNt</a></p> <p>&mdash; Arsenal FC (@Arsenal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/1076658651530588160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Aubameyang is not a selfish player, you don’t get the sense that he would kill a puppy for a goal. He just kind of turns up, skirts around the edges of a game, inevitably scores, does a somersault and then goes home being all affable and stuff. In this sense, his luminous fashion sense and taste for garish vehicles are a bit of a misnomer. He lacks some of the more cerebral qualities of a folk hero.</p> <p>Many have posited that his reputation as a bit of a troublemaker cost him a move to a Super Club while at Dortmund, but Super Clubs aren’t especially put off signing difficult characters (and, thus far, we have not seen that reputation realised at Arsenal, probably the opposite in fact). Aubameyang goes under the radar with the public just as much as he does opposition defenders. So long as he is doing it in an Arsenal shirt, that is just fine with me.</p> <p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Stillberto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Stillberto</a> – Or like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stillberto/." target="_blank" rel="noopener">page on Facebook</a></p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&amp;linkname=Auba%20and%20Under" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fauba-and-under%2F&#038;title=Auba%20and%20Under" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2018/12/auba-and-under/" data-a2a-title="Auba and Under"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> /

Considering some of the personnel he has at the back, to have gone on a 22 game unbeaten run is almost miraculous, and again I think it&#8217;s vital that the club back him in the transfer market in January because otherwise they&#8217;re basically setting him up for a fall.</p> <p>At the same time though, there are days when he doesn&#8217;t get it right and I think yesterday was one of those. The 1-1 draw at Brighton was disappointing, frustrating and in a race for the top four which is getting tighter by the week those are two very costly points that we dropped.</p> <p>We started well, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang putting us ahead early on after good pressing high up the pitch and determined work from Alexandre Lacazette. The striker curled home his 15th goal of the season, Arsenal were well and truly on top, and we should have kicked on from there. Instead, we played safe, conservative football against a team we should have turned the screw on and ultimately it came back to bite us in the arse.</p> <p>Our control of the game diminished, Brighton had a goal disallowed for a foul on Bernd Leno, and the momentum was changing. However, we had a glorious chance to double the lead when Lucas Torreira&#8217;s brilliant ball found Aubameyang&#8217;s intelligent run, but with just the keeper to beat he saw his effort saved by Matt Ryan. We have to give the keeper some credit, but for me that&#8217;s much more a bad miss than a good save, and another illustration of why Emery called for more from the striker a few weeks ago. His goalscoring record is fantastic, there&#8217;s no doubt about that, but when you look at the chances he misses based on the quality we know he has, it could be better.</p> <p>It felt like a pivotal moment. 2-0 and we&#8217;re in real control, but once again our defensive issues manifested themselves and Brighton were level. From our corner a long ball from the back wasn&#8217;t dealt with properly by Stephan Lichtsteiner who headed it into the path of Jurgen Locadia, Matteo Guendouzi&#8217;s inexperience was in evidence again as his pause allowed the striker a clean run on goal, and although Leno came out – I don&#8217;t think he had any choice – the Brighton man went around him and rolled the ball into an empty net.</p> <p>It was a terrible goal to concede, even by our standards, and our inability to make the most of the early strike and the failure to take that chance to double the lead saw us well and truly punished. Then came half-time and the odd decision to bring on Alex Iwobi for Mesut Ozil. Again, Emery insisted it was tactical, and while the German hadn&#8217;t been brilliant in the first half I think the change was too hasty. On top of that, we were even worse in the second half than the first, unable to get the ball up the pitch, and by the 68th minute Iwobi had only touched the ball 8 times.</p> <p>That was exacerbated by the fact he did nothing of value with it when he got it, but it showed that our problems went beyond the attacking personnel – we simply had no way or getting the ball to them. Clearly the decision to play three central midfielders was made because our back four was so weak, but taking off Lacazette for Ramsey was another strange choice. For me, considering we needed a goal, bringing on the Welshman for the overplayed Guendouzi would have been the more obvious option, but in a game in which we required a goal the manager took off a striker. Lacazette&#8217;s frustration was obvious again, understandably so, and Emery needs to be careful he doesn&#8217;t create a problem for himself here.</p> <p>Ramsey got involved, creating opportunities for Aubameyang and substitute Ainsley Maitland-Niles, but their touch let them down at the key moments. Meanwhile, if any team looked likely to score it was Brighton who ended the game with 12 attempts on goal to our 7 despite the fact we had almost 70% possession. There&#8217;s a dearth of creativity in this team, particularly from central areas. If we can get the ball wide to a full-back or wing-back and cut it back that&#8217;s about as much as we&#8217;ve got without someone like Ramsey or Ozil, both of whom are used minimally by Emery for various reasons.</p> <p>Yes, there was that Torreira pass for Aubameyang for his big chance, but that&#8217;s the exception, not the rule. And while I understand the need for Emery to protect a cobbled together defence – yesterday he had to play a central defender incapable of going 90 minutes in the Premier League, and had a veteran at right back who looks so far off the pace it actually makes me a bit sad for him – I think sometimes he has to play to the strengths we have a bit more and those are further up the pitch.</p> <p>Even with my glass still relatively half-full, there wasn&#8217;t a single thing to like about that second half performance yesterday. Emery&#8217;s decision making has to be called into question for a game in which three points were vital, but it was also a clear indication of how threadbare we are in certain areas of the pitch. If there isn&#8217;t at least one defensive recruitment in January then we&#8217;re going to find life very difficult indeed, and you could easily see how adding something in the top end of the pitch would improve us too.</p> <p>If Emery doesn&#8217;t trust Ozil – and there&#8217;s growing evidence to suggest that&#8217;s the case, and Alex Iwobi&#8217;s step forward this season has now seen him take a couple back, then we&#8217;re very thin on players who can provide what the strikers need. Ramsey is not a long-term option (I do wonder if circumstances might cause a rethink in that regard, a new contract for him might be easier and better value than a signing); Mkhitaryan is out for 6 weeks but lacks consistency; and beyond that we&#8217;re now really feeling the impact of the Danny Welbeck injury. Even that situation, with all due respect to him, tells its own story. This is a player the club had no interest in giving a new deal to anyway, so would require replacing at the end of the season.</p> <p>I suspect that the Raul, Sven and Unai triangle of football would have planned and preferred to make changes and decisions in the summer. I think we can all understand why, but they now need to step back and take stock of where we are and what&#8217;s happening. We&#8217;re still just 2 points off 4th, but United are now only 6 points back and as a team we&#8217;re not playing the kind of football that would make you confident we can maintain the challenge until May. We&#8217;ve dropped 5 points in two weeks against teams in the bottom half of the table, and it&#8217;s blindingly obvious that Emery is struggling with a squad stretched to its absolute limits.</p> <p>It doesn&#8217;t means some of decisions can&#8217;t be questioned, and I don&#8217;t think yesterday will go down as one of his best days by a long way, but it feels like we need to make a statement in January through action or inaction. Either one would tell us plenty about what this club is about now, and whether it&#8217;s really as ambitious as the owners tell us. Emery needs players, it&#8217;s as simple as that.

It was nice to switch off for a day, not having to keep an eye on the Arsenal news cycle but we know that festive football is an important part of the Premier League calendar so we&#8217;re right back into it today.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a trip to Brighton later this afternoon, and Unai Emery still has plenty to contend with when putting his team together. We know all about the defensive injuries which don&#8217;t leave him with a great deal to work with, and further forward there&#8217;s a blow with the news that <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/mkhitaryan-ruled-out-for-six-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henrikh Mkhitaryan will be out for 6 weeks</a> having fractured a metatarsal in the Carabao Cup game against Sp*rs. He has been a bit hit and miss this season, but at this time of the year, with so much football to play, having as many players fit and available as possible is always a help.</p> <p>Then there&#8217;s the Lucas Torreira situation which would certainly give me pause for thought today. I know we have a tendency to look at things wearing our &#8216;worst case scenario&#8217; glasses, but having picked up four bookings already this season a yellow card against Brighton would mean he&#8217;s suspended for the trip to Anfield on Saturday. If it were up to me – which obviously it&#8217;s not – I&#8217;d be inclined to leave him on the bench for this game, using him only if absolutely necessary, but Emery doesn&#8217;t appear to be thinking the same way.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote><p>In my career, I never made these decisions. We are going to play the next match in Brighton and we are going to play full – not with considered options or playing with more caution. The same three points are in Brighton that are in Liverpool and we are going to play first in Brighton. It’s a tough match and we will need every player with 100% focus to do everything on the pitch to win.</p> <p>I don’t know whether Torreira would even be able to play cautiously but I don’t want him to think about the possibility of a suspension for one yellow card.</p></blockquote> <p>And look, I understand it. In our last away game, against a team near the bottom of the table who hadn&#8217;t won since September 1st, we lost 3-2, so the manager is well aware you can&#8217;t take anything for granted in this league. Our cobbled together defence means that you need to be as strong as possible everywhere else, and there&#8217;s no question that our best midfield always contains the Uruguayan.</p> <p>But I also feel like as long as we have a couple of central defenders available to us today we have enough depth in midfield to win this game without Torreira. Maybe that&#8217;s just me though, and as a fan it&#8217;s hard to look at today&#8217;s game and not see the Liverpool fixture on the horizon. As good as they&#8217;ve been this season we gave them a good game at the Emirates last month and Torreira was a really key part of that performance, so being without him at Anfield would be a blow.</p> <p>Emery is aware of this, I&#8217;m sure, but might think that dropping points against Brighton if he doesn&#8217;t pick his strongest team won&#8217;t be taken lightly regardless of what happens in the subsequent game. He has to prioritise three points today then consider how to get a result against Liverpool, even if the worst happens and Torreira gets a booking. I don&#8217;t think 3 points today will exempt him from criticism, but we could win get no yellow cards so let&#8217;s hope that happens.</p> <p>Up front Aubameyang seems likely to start after his two goal salvo against Burnley, but Lacazette started that game too, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if he sticks with that. Also, is Brighton away sufficiently less physical than Bournemouth for Mesut Ozil to start? As ever with Emery we don&#8217;t know exactly how he&#8217;s going to approach things, but let&#8217;s hope that whatever team he picks we can pick up the three points and keep that race for the top four as tight as possible.</p> <p>We will have a <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> for you, and all the usual post-match stuff on <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arseblog News</a> so join us for that.

The table at Christmas is often used as a kind of marker, so here&#8217;s how things look in the Premier League right now:</p> <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27941" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas.jpg" alt="" width="1812" height="550" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas.jpg 1812w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-300x91.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-768x233.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-1024x311.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-696x211.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-1068x324.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/pl_christmas-1384x420.jpg 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 1812px) 100vw, 1812px" /></p> <p>I think if someone had offered you this at the start of the season, most people would have taken it. Only Man City have scored more goals than us, which tells you where the strength in our side is, but the goals against tally tells you where things need improvement. We&#8217;ve conceded far more than any other team in the top four, and Manchester United&#8217;s defensive issues were basically down to the players hating Jose Mourinho and thus not being arsed to defend properly. It&#8217;s a bit of an outlier.</p> <p>So, how does Unai Emery make things better at the back? As I&#8217;ve written here before, the Spaniard was well aware of our defensive frailties, and as far back as August we had staff saying <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/08/darren-burgess-workaholic-emery-is-focused-on-defensive-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how focused he was on addressing those issues</a>. In some ways he&#8217;s been a bit unlucky because we&#8217;ve had injuries to contend with. The Rob Holding one is the most obvious, but Sokratis has been in and out, Nacho Monreal looks like time might be catching up to his hamstrings, Sead Kolasinac missed a big chunk of the season, Hector Bellerin is out now, as is Mustafi, while Laurent Koscielny is just making his way back from a significant and traumatic injury.</p> <p>In the last few weeks we&#8217;ve had to cobble together a defence, the weakness of which was on display at Southampton, and even against Burnley we could see the problems but our firepower saw us through that game. So, this is how we can defend with these players with Emery working his arse off to make the team better at the back. At some point you have to step back and ask how much can he actually get from them? Is it an issue of system or coaching, or do we have to consider the possibility that until we improve on the personnel this is going to be as good as it gets?</p> <p>I have to admit I lean quite strongly towards the latter view. There&#8217;s only so much he can wring out of some these players, and until such time as we make headway in the transfer market, we&#8217;ll continue to be hit and miss back there. That&#8217;s why, when you look at the table and the position we&#8217;re in, you hope the people in charge of the club – the Kroenkes and the executives now running the football side of things – give Emery their backing in the transfer market in January.</p> <p>Yes, it&#8217;s more difficult to do deals during this particular window. Yes, we all understand the players aren&#8217;t always available, but it&#8217;s not a hard and fast rule. I&#8217;ll point you to our leading scorer, and the Premier League&#8217;s leading scorer this season, a certain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund last January. So, sometimes the players are there if you&#8217;re willing to go for it and you have smart people to make the deals happen.</p> <p>I think we have those people now, and I hope they&#8217;re trying their best to source the kind of player we need back there. We&#8217;re short in depth, as the continued presence of Granit Xhaka in defence clearly illustrates, and short on the requisite quality as our goals against column shows in black and white. If the stated ambition to get this club back into the Champions League is actually that – and not just a thing that KSE said when they bought out Alisher Usmanov and subsequently every other shareholder – now is the time to demonstrate it.</p> <p>Calls for transfer activity are often met with the &#8220;But who is out there that we can get?&#8221; question, and my answer is: I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s not my job to know. That&#8217;s why we have a former Barcelona Director of Football running the show; alongside a Head of Recruitment with a team of scouts who has a good eye for players few of us had heard about until they arrived (Torreira and Guendouzi); a Contract Dude to make it all happen; and a manager who has <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/emery-eyeing-a-defensive-addition-in-the-january-transfer-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made it quite clear publicly</a> that he needs to strengthen his team in this key area.</p> <p>So, as we head into this most wonderful time of the year, it&#8217;s over to the men at the very top and it&#8217;s time for Stanta to reach into his leathery old sack, and make sure that Unai Emery has what he needs for the rest of the season. Disturbing Christmas imagery I realise, but that&#8217;s the long and short of it.</p> <p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a bit of a day off but I&#8217;ll be here on the 26th to preview the Brighton game: to Torreira or not Torreira, that is the question. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to listen already there&#8217;s a <a href="https://arseblog.com/2018/12/arsecast-extra-episode-263-23-12-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand new Arsecast Extra</a> for you to listen to, full of post-Burnley cheer so get that into your ears.</p> <p>Finally, I’d just like to take the opportunity on behalf of all of us here at Arseblog and Arseblog News to wish you all a very happy Christmas. I know not everyone who reads is celebrating it, but whether you do or not, I hope you have peace and love, health and happiness – things that would make the world a better place whatever you do at this time of the year.</p> <p>Catch you on the far side.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&amp;linkname=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2018%2F12%2Fa-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players%2F&#038;title=A%20time%20for%20giving%20%E2%80%A6%20the%20manager%20some%20new%20players" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2018/12/a-time-for-giving-the-manager-some-new-players/" data-a2a-title="A time for giving … the manager some new players"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item>

The striker was still annoyed that he&#8217;d got booked for his tussle with Sokratis, feeling he&#8217;d been picked on, while Dyche accused Arsenal of spoiling football for millions of children by diving all the time.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t usually take sure pleasure in the reaction of the opposition after a game we&#8217;ve won, but I did yesterday. It was a hard-fought win because they made it hard. They were tough, physical, hard-working and wanted to beat up on what they perceived as a team who don&#8217;t usually like it when the game is played that way – but Arsenal under Unai Emery are a different animal. We&#8217;re not as meek, and there are some characters in this team who will fight fire with fire, and bullying with shithousing.</p> <p>Take the Greek centre-half. I think Barnes might have had a right to have feel unhappy when Sokratis&#8217; elbow connected with the side of his head as he pulled him down near the touchline. Was it deliberate from Sokratis? There&#8217;s no way to prove that. I know what I think, and I think if there&#8217;s a chance to get a dig in on a bloke who is quite prepared to give it back then he&#8217;ll take it. Barnes reaction got him a yellow card, and not long later Sokratis had one for a super-annoying foul on halfway which the Burnley man almost reacted to in the exact way I&#8217;m sure our man was hoping he would when he was making the challenge.</p> <p>Maybe too Burnley have a right to complain about what I thought was Lichtsteiner throwing himself into the air, winning a free kick after Barnes had got the wrong side of him, but that&#8217;s experience and years of playing in Italy right there. He&#8217;d have a looked a bit of plonker had it not been given but it was, and there you go. Meanwhile, Barnes was kneeing Guendouzi in the back then almost stamping on him, Xhaka got flattened by a challenge which was a yellow all day long, and the referee allowed the visitors to be as physical as they wanted. Swings and roundabouts. If you&#8217;re going to bend the rules one way expect us to bend them the other, shut the hell up about it and don&#8217;t moan and cry afterwards when it doesn&#8217;t go the way you want.</p> <p>Mesut Ozil&#8217;s return to the team was notable, as was the pass he made in the build up to our opening goal. Kolasinac&#8217;s run was ambitious, the pass even more so as he bent it around the defence with pin-point accuracy, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was there to shin the ball into the bottom corner to make it 1-0. That&#8217;s the kind of quality he has, nobody&#8217;s ever doubted that, it&#8217;s the application of his talent that&#8217;s been in question, and if Emery&#8217;s treatment of him was designed to elicit a response, then we can look at his midweek decision as good management thus far.</p> <p>Leno was brave to head away early in the second half as a Burnley player got booked for kicking him in the belly, and after some good defending the lead was doubled. A break from the back saw Lacazette feed Aubameyang who finished to make it 2-0. Interestingly, he said afterwards they&#8217;d practised those kind of finishing scenarios in training yesterday, so that may well have played a part in how emphatic the finish was.</p> <p>Having lost Nacho Monreal in the first half and reverted to a back three, it&#8217;s fair to say we didn&#8217;t always look comfortable at the back. I think without Sokratis we really would have struggled, this was easily his best game for us, the kind of game he relishes due to its physicality, but his natural defensive instincts were important more than once. That aside though, he was excellent on the ball too, so it was fine display from the former Borussia Dortmund man.</p> <p>One of things Emery has yet to get on top of is our defence and we&#8217;ve spoken more than once about how many goals we conceded. Yesterday&#8217;s concession was scrappy, we didn&#8217;t get the ball clear and it broke to Barnes, a player lucky enough to be still on the pitch, and he slammed the ball home – much to the displeasure of Lichtsteiner who pounded the earth like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes.</p> <p>The introduction of Lucas Torreira gave us a bit more bite in midfield but not much more control and it was a nervy time. We&#8217;ve been in this scenario before and it always feels like an opposition goal is inevitable. Lacazette came off for Iwobi, the Frenchman&#8217;s frustration obvious on the bench, but it was the replacement who sealed the game. He&#8217;d been involved in the move earlier, Ozil&#8217;s shot/pass deflected into his path and he finished from a position some have said was offside but I don&#8217;t care if he was or he wasn&#8217;t, the goal stood and that was always going to be enough to ensure the three points.</p> <p>Like many of the games we&#8217;ve won this season, it was a bit of a grind, but we&#8217;ve done it so often now that it&#8217;s got to be seen as something more than luck. There&#8217;s a measure of character and resilience to these results, and it&#8217;s necessary because it is hard going right now. I think the lack of a real back four is hard to cope with. Yesterday we played a young midfielder at right back, a left back at centre-half, and when he went off we had a central midfielder in a back three along with a veteran wing-back/full back in there too. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for a solid defensive platform on which to build your play, and we don&#8217;t have that right now.</p> <p>I think it&#8217;s a major issue, one I hope that the club will address in the upcoming transfer window, but in the meantime if Emery can get results out of this team with a defence that&#8217;s stitched together like Frankenstein&#8217;s monster then I think we have to be happy with that. Yesterday the goal threat of Aubameyang, Ozil&#8217;s creativity, the danger provided by Sead Kolasinac down the left, and Arsenal&#8217;s unwillingness to be beaten up by the opposition proved enough to take all three points.</p> <p>Each game will be a different challenge, we have an away trip to Brighton now on Wednesday then we go to Anfield. Emery will have plenty to think about in terms of how to approach those games and what kind of team to select, but he can do so with the comfort of an enjoyable Christmas win.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>James and I will be recording an Arsecast Extra for you this morning.

That is not a euphemism for anything, I was merely drinking cocktails with a Duke. You’re thinking of drinking cocktails with a Duchess, an act which it would not be appropriate to describe in a family foot-balling column.</p> <p>The faithful knew that Middlesex would have their dander up following their humiliation in the actual North London and South Middlesex Derby on December 2nd. We know that Spurs require a huge uplift in their revenue stream to pay for the Armitage Shanks Stadium, and that by rushing out a DVD called ‘A NIGHT TO REMEMBER: KNOCKING ARSENAL OUT OF THE CARABAO CUP’ will sell quite well to the unfortunate inhabitants of that ghastly London suburb.</p> <p>I hear that Tottenham’s official club shop, situtated as it is in the heart of a population of feral criminals, expect large numbers of new DVDs to be filched from their establishment, but even so, sales revenue will go toward the billion pound cost of their new hovel. And so, a defeat was written in the stars.</p> <p>I awoke on the Thursday morning to the newspaper coverage. As you will know, following a loss, my kindly butler excises the match report from the Telegraph for the fear of me reaching for my bedside Purdey and firing off a couple of rage rounds through the window. Yet he played something of a trick on me, leaving the headline ‘MISSILE THROWN AT DELE ALLI’. This of course filled me with great joy, for any moral gentleman would be delighted for a missile to be thrown at that despicable footpad. I thought that an actual missile had been thrown, an exocet or similar, and all that was left of Mr. Alli was a pair of smouldering white boots on the Emirates pitch; sadly ‘twas but a humble water bottle.</p> <p>This had me pondering: Is it possible to condemn the actions of the fan who threw a bottle at Dele Alli whilst applauding the accuracy of the throw itself? Considering Alli’s annoying and slappable bonce is approximately 30% smaller than a normal human head, and the bottle was thrown from some distance, was there not a tiny bit of admiration there? Of course the reprehensible cove should be banned and so on, but any local cricketing teams may wish to seek him or her out.</p> <p>And can we find contentment in the fact that a plastic bottle of water has no racial connotations, unlike the banana thrown by a Spurs fan last week? In the current climate, can we take succour in being a less racist club, in terms of racially connotative objects thrown from the crowd? Perhaps we could take the lead on this for the next Spurs match, highlighting our progressive qualities as a club.</p> <p>How about hurling replicas of culturally significant artefacts from Africa and Asia; a rubber version of the wonderful cast bronze head of Queen Idia of Benin from the 16th century thrown at Paulo Gazzaniga? A lightweight plastic Shiva Nataraja from 12th century Tamil Nadu slung at the head of Harry Winks? A 13th century astrolabe from Turkey fashioned into a Frisbee and directed at Jan Vertonghen?</p> <p>In my day, missile throwing was an important part of the match-day ritual and has become much less creative over time. It was a rite of passage for any young chap or chapess attending their first match at Highbury to attempt to hit a policeman on the head with a clothes peg, or the away goalkeeper with an orange, or an opposing fan with a clothes mangle smuggled into the ground under one’s wife’s voluminous underskirts.</p> <p>Or my particular favourite on Boxing Day, to hit the opposing manager with a Cockentrice (a dish consisting of a suckling pig&#8217;s upper body sewn onto the bottom half of a capon or turkey).</p> <p>Perhaps these traditions can be reintroduced at the weekend. If someone manages to get Sean Dyche on the noggin with some oyster soup then please see me to collect your one guinea.

Whether he meant that for him, his players or the fans is unclear. Perhaps all concerned, but today we&#8217;ll see what that defeat taught him about his team and what they&#8217;re capable of.</p> <p>With regards to injuries we&#8217;re without Shkodran Mustafi and Hector Bellerin at the back, and in his pre-game press conference, the boss cast some doubt on Laurent Koscielny&#8217;s participation. Since his comeback last Thursday he&#8217;s started twice and came on at half-time in the midweek derby, so you can understand why they might need to be cautious this early in the process.</p> <p>The return from injury of Sead Kolasinac might allow him to play Nacho Monreal at centre-half alongside Sokratis in a back four but he may well stick to a back three, and unless he feels he can use Koscielny then we might see Granit Xhaka there again. On the one hand I admire the Swiss international&#8217;s willingness to help the team where he&#8217;s asked, and Emery said he felt Xhaka had played well at centre-half, but if at all possible I&#8217;d like to avoid this.</p> <p>Firstly, and very basically, I think we miss him in midfield. Secondly, as willing as he is and as hard as he tries, he doesn&#8217;t possess the natural defensive instincts required. We&#8217;ve seen some players do it in the past, but very few are good enough to excel and I&#8217;m not sure Xhaka is one of them. I&#8217;ve seen people ask why not use a young centre-half from the academy, like Zech Medley, but I can only assume they&#8217;re not considered ready for Premier League action. Emery has shown that if he feels a young player is good enough he&#8217;ll play him, see Matteo Guendouzi, but midfield is a little more forgiving than the centre of the defence, so it could well be makeshift back there again today and it will make things more challenging.</p> <p>Further forward Henrikh Mkhitaryan is out but <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/emery-ozil-in-squad-and-has-arsenal-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mesut Ozil is back in the squad</a>. I referred to the manager as an &#8216;arch-pragmatist&#8217; earlier this week, and he&#8217;ll understand as well as anyone what a fit and firing Ozil can bring to his team. By leaving him out of the Sp*rs game in midweek he sent a clear message to the player – and every other player in his squad – and now it&#8217;s time for the number 10 to respond.</p> <p>&#8220;Yes. Why not?&#8221;, was Emery&#8217;s response to a question at his press conference as to whether or not Ozil had a future at the club, but he made it crystal clear that a player&#8217;s salary or reputation will have no bearing on whether he plays or not. <a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/emery-salary-has-no-influence-on-team-selection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He said</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>For me the player’s salary is not important. I don’t know the players’ salary because for me they are the same. To every player I give the same conversation and the same decision to play or not. It’s not only him. For me every player is the same. If you make a difference between them because one has more salary – for me it has to be the same.</p></blockquote> <p>The subtext is also pretty obvious: your salary doesn&#8217;t offer you extra benefits like special treatment. Everyone is the same, everyone has to work hard, everyone has do what&#8217;s asked of them. If you don&#8217;t like it, or if you throw a strop, you don&#8217;t play, and we had hard evidence of that this week.</p> <p>I genuinely hope we see an on-pitch response from Ozil who hasn&#8217;t been at his best this season and has struggled to find consistent form. I know there are issues with the system, or systems, and his place in them, but there&#8217;s a wonderfully talented footballer in our squad whose contributions this season have been far too sporadic for the quality he possesses. If he can help us take three points today against Burnley, then I&#8217;d be delighted, and there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that an in-form Ozil makes us a better team. Baby steps though.</p> <p>Up front, will it be Aubameyang, Lacazette, or both? I&#8217;d be inclined to give the Frenchman a start with his mate going into his sixth game without a goal. We could well see Aubameyang on the left today though, an alternative to Alex Iwobi who has found the going a bit tough in recent weeks and could well do with a bit of a rest. Anyway, as ever Emery is a hard man to second guess when it comes to team selection and all will be revealed soon enough as we head into this early kick off.</p> <p>We&#8217;ll have a <a href="http://p1r.es/ArseblogLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> for you if you&#8217;re out doing your Christmas shopping and can&#8217;t see the game, and all the post-match stuff on <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arseblog News</a>.</p> <p>Right, that&#8217;s it.

The Mesut Ozil situation rumbles on, which is no less than you&#8217;d expect really. Despite some people&#8217;s desire to explain this away as a casual piece of tactical thinking from Unai Emery –<em> &#8220;He&#8217;s saving him for the more important games, like Burnley at home!&#8221;</em> – when a player of his stature is dumped for a North London derby it&#8217;s a story that will reverberate.</p> <p><a href="https://arseblog.news/2018/12/report-arsenal-could-loan-mesut-ozil-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a report in today&#8217;s Times</a>, it&#8217;s suggested that after training ground clashes over his work-rate and more, Arsenal are willing to sell Ozil as early as January but, understanding that the £350,000 a week he&#8217;s paid might well make a deal prohibitive for most potential buyers, would be willing to loan him while subsidising his wages to help facilitate the move. Talk of the club&#8217;s willingness to sell was also in the Independent yesterday, and regardless of how you view the veracity of those stories, it&#8217;s a remarkable turnaround from where we were back at the end of January.</p> <p>With under 6 months left on his deal, with Alexis gone to Manchester United and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan just arrived, the renewal of his contract was met with genuine excitement. Even if eyebrows were raised at the size of the salary, it felt important that Arsenal held onto a star player – and one who could have left on a free, let&#8217;s remember. The idea of that was anathema at the time, and would rightly have had people asking serious questions about the ambition and direction the club was going in. I wonder if you asked people to revisit that situation now how many would think his departure might have been for best. Hindsight is 20/20, of course.</p> <p>What we have now though is a particularly unhealthy situation for the club, the player and the manager. When asked on Wednesday evening if Ozil had a future at the club, it would have been very simple for Unai Emery to say something like &#8216;Yes, every player is important. We all want to see Mesut Ozil back to his best and on the pitch for Arsenal&#8217;. Instead he <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/emery-why-ozil-didnt-feature-carabao-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly skirted the issue</a>, and ultimately dropping him for a North London derby sent a much bigger message than anything he might have to say.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t think Emery is a stupid man, and I&#8217;m quite sure he would be delighted to have a Mesut Ozil at the top of his game available to him. When he arrived back from the World Cup he offered very public support, saying the &#8216;Arsenal family&#8217;, would be there for him after what was a difficult summer on, but especially off the pitch. He then got down to doing his new job, demanding more from a squad which had been in a comfort zone under Arsene Wenger, and while I&#8217;m sure he expected most of the players to buy into his methods, he&#8217;d have understood that some simply wouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s natural, it happens at every football club, and 6 months down the line it looks as if Ozil is someone who isn&#8217;t into what Emery is doing.</p> <p>Maybe it&#8217;s because Emery has treated everybody the same way and expected the same from all of his players. He had to create a level playing field, but since his arrival in 2013 Ozil&#8217;s star quality meant he was indulged more than others. There&#8217;s an informative snippet from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUDRBYP4-lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Ramsey in a Soccer AM video</a> when asked who was the teacher&#8217;s pet at Arsenal. He says:</p> <blockquote><p>Probably Mesut. He gets a few extra days off than the rest of us. He’s always in the boss’s room asking for something … and he seems to get it.</p></blockquote> <p>It&#8217;s somewhat tongue in cheek but it not untrue. That was Wenger&#8217;s way. An arm around the shoulder, indulging him when he wanted time off, and I suspect that the new regime has not been anywhere near as accommodating. If a new manager comes in and gives one player an inch, why wouldn&#8217;t every other player try and take a mile? It feels like the root cause of this is disciplinary, because it can&#8217;t really be about footballing ability.</p> <p>Leaving work-rate aside, Ozil is one of the most gifted individuals we have in this squad. His creativity and vision is matched by few in Europe, let alone the other players we have available to us, regardless of how dismissive his fiercest critics are of him. Look at his record in terms of assists, look at how many chances he creates, but there&#8217;s little doubt we haven&#8217;t seen him anywhere near his best for some time now. It was understandable last season to suggest the dying embers of Wenger&#8217;s reign made assessing individual performances difficult, but this season we&#8217;ve seen what we might consider the real Mesut Ozil, the Mesut Ozil we jumped around with joy about when he signed from Real Madrid, just once.</p> <p>He was superb in that Leicester game, and you can be sure that kind of player and that kind of performance is something any manager would want in their team. It was a one off though. We haven&#8217;t see him play anywhere near that well since, and his dismal cameo against Southampton last week was the chalk to that particular cheese (Red Leicester?!).</p> <p>It is a complicated situation however. There&#8217;s a PR machine set up to protect Ozil the player and Ozil the brand, so they would have you believe all is well. Arsenal, as a club, won&#8217;t add fuel to any fire like this, but Emery&#8217;s decision to leave him out of the derby and subsequent comments tell you a lot. Leave his idiosyncratic English aside, he could have publicly backed the player if he&#8217;d wanted to and played the whole thing down. He didn&#8217;t and you have to ask why, and ask why any manager would deny himself that kind of talent without good reason.</p> <p>I know as player he&#8217;s many people&#8217;s favourite, and I get that, but I also believe it&#8217;s important that in this – as in any other walk of life – it&#8217;s important to think critically about what we&#8217;re seeing. There&#8217;s something serious going on here, it&#8217;s not healthy for the club or the team, and it&#8217;s important that the people running the football side of Arsenal act decisively to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t become an even bigger distraction than it already is.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>Ozil is the subject of some discussion on today&#8217;s Arsecast with James, along with the Sp*rs game, some Christmas waffle and more.
