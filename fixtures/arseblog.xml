It&#8217;s fair to say there was a range of opinion, some people agreed, some people didn&#8217;t, some people agreed with bits but not other bits, and that&#8217;s absolutely fine. Thanks to everyone who engaged politely and respectfully, it&#8217;s never any issue to disagree on something. Football, and the world itself, would be very boring if that was the case, and I&#8217;m just a bloke with a blog about Arsenal. I&#8217;m not suggesting everyone should think like I do or anything like it. I don&#8217;t claim to be an all wise oracle, it&#8217;s just what&#8217;s in my head, maaaaan.</p> <p>As for those who view someone&#8217;s opinion on a football player as an excuse to go on the attack, it&#8217;s just further evidence – if it were needed – that there&#8217;s little middle ground and no nuance these days in public discourse. If you&#8217;re not THIS, then you&#8217;re THAT. It&#8217;s not surprising in any way, and it&#8217;s not an issue that&#8217;s unique to football, but when there&#8217;s that much of it, it can be a bit disconcerting. Still, sticks and stones and all that.</p> <p>One of the things that came up from people who were prepared to discuss the issue rationally was the club&#8217;s role in this, and that&#8217;s a very fair point and one I probably should have incorporated into yesterday&#8217;s article. Mesut Ozil didn&#8217;t give himself a £350,000 a week contract, that was a deal and salary negotiated with the player&#8217;s agent over time by Ivan Gazidis, Huss Fahmy and then sanctioned by the board. Arsenal had been trying and failing to agree terms with him for more than a year, and with Alexis on his way out that January they clearly felt that losing both the star players would have been too damaging for the club&#8217;s reputation.</p> <p><strong>Update</strong>: I&#8217;ve been reliably informed that Huss Fahmy was not involved in the Ozil deal. It was Dick Law who negotiated it with Gazidis and Arsene Wenger approving the various facets of it throughout.</p> <p>Did that give Ozil and his people a stronger hand in negotiations? Of course. Whose fault was that? Arsenal&#8217;s. It was similar to the 2013 contract renewal for Theo Walcott who, like Ozil, was into the final 6 months of his deal, and having recently lost Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri and Robin van Persie in contentious fashion, it left Arsenal over a barrel and the contract he signed made him the club&#8217;s highest paid player at that time. It&#8217;s also not a coincidence that the club announced the Ozil renewal at the end of the transfer window, or just after, to give it maximum impact too.</p> <p>Fast forward to now from January last year and the goodwill the deal generated at the time is more or less gone. I don&#8217;t think I want to get into the nuts and bolts of it all again, but since he signed that contract it&#8217;s not unreasonable to say that we haven&#8217;t seen the best of him. The end of the last campaign was a dismal thing for everyone, so it&#8217;s hard to read too much into his performances there, and this season – after a difficult summer – has gone downhill in a big way.</p> <p>The question everyone&#8217;s asking is why, and the fact is we don&#8217;t know. We can only speculate. Is it because Unai Emery doesn&#8217;t like him? Well, Unai Emery supposedly wowed our football triumvirate with a dossier about each and every player – even Ainsley Maitland-Niles – so he can&#8217;t have been unaware of the kind of player Ozil is. In fact, it was suggested <a href="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/episode-513-behind-the-january-transfer-window-with-david-ornstein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Arsecast with David Ornstein</a> a couple of weeks ago, that he was someone Emery fancied signing for PSG, so issues about the style of player or his personality don&#8217;t really add up. Also, if Ozil is so anathema to the way that Emery wants to play, why did Arsenal hire a manager so incompatible with their star player?</p> <p>Is Emery being told by the board not to play Ozil in order to make his life as uncomfortable as possible so he&#8217;ll be more inclined to leave? I can certainly believe that Arsenal would want Ozil to go so they can redistribute his wages, but any manager who is complicit in that kind of scenario is a lame duck and far too weak to be managing a club like Arsenal. I look at our squad, I look at the issues we have with creativity, and I can&#8217;t get my head around the idea of a manager denying himself a supremely talented player for no good reason.</p> <p>People pointed out to me that Emery had some issues with players at PSG, but if your mandate is to get the team into the top four, you know you&#8217;ve got a better chance of doing that if you have a player like Ozil in form and providing the ammunition for your two top strikers. If this theory about isolating Ozil on purpose to make him look at his future elsewhere is true – and again I find it hard to believe it is – then it&#8217;s a terrible way to manage this situation.</p> <p>How has the player&#8217;s behaviour been? If we&#8217;re going to consider all the potential factors, that has to be one them too. Has he found it difficult to deal with the fact he&#8217;s not given the same kind of leeway as he was under Arsene Wenger? Every player is the same to Emery, a mantra he keeps repeating, and that wasn&#8217;t the case before. Some players were special. The early season bust-up when he stormed away from the training ground after discovering he was going to be on the bench for West Ham is perhaps a sign that he hasn&#8217;t always behaved as well as he might. People might not like this, but it could well be a part of it.</p> <p>Whatever it is, it feels to me like there&#8217;s something more going on, something we don&#8217;t know about. We won&#8217;t hear it from Ozil&#8217;s side because we get that PR version of him and they&#8217;re not going to do anything that might damage brand Ozil. We won&#8217;t hear it from Arsenal or Emery because they&#8217;re not going to play their hand publicly unless they have absolutely no other choice. If we start to hear things via the back channels, if all the journalists on the Arsenal beat suddenly get an Ozil story, then we can figure out where it came from, but until now that hasn&#8217;t happened.</p> <p>What we do know for certain is that this is unhealthy for Arsenal. We&#8217;ve just lost to BATE Borisov – our 7th defeat in 14 games – and we&#8217;re not playing well. It&#8217;s easy to see how Ozil could help the way we play football if he performs, and why people are hoping to see him back in the team. It&#8217;s unhealthy for Ozil, for Emery, for the board, and it would be unhealthy for KSE if they really cared but they&#8217;re distant and have delegated the running of the club to Raul Sanllehi and Vinai Venkatesham.</p> <p>As touched on in that Arsecast episode I mentioned earlier (<a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/ornstein-on-the-arsecast-the-full-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript here</a> if you prefer), the culture of a club should be set by the people at the very top. From what I&#8217;m told, there&#8217;s no urgency stateside for Arsenal to produce this season, with suggestions that because it took Liverpool some years under the Fenway ownership to build a successful team, they&#8217;re quite prepared for that kind of scenario to play out at Arsenal. It might go some way to explain the lack of January investment, but the idea that top four and Champions League is a must for KSE this season is wide of the mark.</p> <p>Now, it might well be a priority for Sanllehi who is the man in complete control of football matters at Arsenal, and ultimately it&#8217;s going to be down to him to drive this club forward. Obviously that&#8217;s within the scope of what he&#8217;s allowed to do and spend by KSE, but so much of our hopes rest on him, his ambitions, and how good he is at his job.</p> <p>Right now though, he has a big problem to deal with this season. If Arsenal view Ozil&#8217;s wage packet as a burden, isn&#8217;t there a good case to be made for wringing as much value out of it as possible? That can only happen with the player on the pitch. If he doesn&#8217;t perform or can&#8217;t find his mojo again, it probably just cements the summer plans in their mind. If he can pull some strings through, and Arsenal win games and points and keep up the fight for the top four, then it&#8217;s not £350,000 a week down the drain, which is kind of what it is at the moment.</p> <p>In time, I&#8217;m sure the truth – or some version of it – will come out about this whole thing, and I&#8217;m convinced there&#8217;ll be something we don&#8217;t know about it right now. Until then, all parties need to come together to broker whatever kind of uneasy truce is necessary for the benefit of the team, because that ought to the priority for all of them.</p> <p>Right, have a nice peaceful Sunday, and let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s something else to talk about soon.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&amp;linkname=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fthe-continuation%2F&#038;title=The%20continuation%20%E2%80%A6" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/the-continuation/" data-a2a-title="The continuation …"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>Arsenal the collateral damage of the Mesut Ozil Tweet</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 07:37:13 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[mesut ozil]]></category> <category><![CDATA[unai emery]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28344</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ozil_2019-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Good morning.

It&#8217;s an Arsenal free weekend, so this blog is likely to be short and succinct because there&#8217;s nothing going on. So much nothing. As Ned Flanders might say, &#8220;Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all.&#8221;</p> <p>Just a whole pile of no news. So, I guess we&#8217;ll leave it there for today, thanks for reading, and I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow &#8230; ok, ok &#8230; there&#8217;s the Mesut Ozil Tweet which has got people talking in a big way, and I&#8217;m being somewhat diplomatic there. Yesterday evening the German, or his social media team, or his social media team with the tacit approval of the German, sent out this:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;When you start supporting a football club, you don&#39;t support it because of the trophies, or a player, or history, you support it because you found yourself somewhere there; found a place where you belong.&#39; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f64f-1f3fc.png" alt="🙏🏼" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> || <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DennisBergkamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DennisBergkamp</a> <a href="https://t.co/kKM8kDhm8T">pic.twitter.com/kKM8kDhm8T</a></p> <p>&mdash; Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) <a href="https://twitter.com/MesutOzil1088/status/1096485650168233985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2019</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Some will say this Ozil simply demonstrating how much he loves Arsenal, a reminder to the fans that while he&#8217;s out of the team he&#8217;s still one them (he&#8217;s not, let&#8217;s be real – very few players are fans of the clubs they play for. It&#8217;s a job). Others will say the timing of this, coming after a bad result, is a way to play to the crowd because we were terrible against BATE Borisov, and when you play that badly and results are poor, it&#8217;s natural that people will wonder if Ozil could have made a difference.</p> <p>Personally, I think it&#8217;s a pretty cynical move – because anyone with half a brain can see that this would immediately create a discord among fans. If you don&#8217;t think it has, check the replies which are full of &#8216;Fuck Emery&#8217; and &#8216;Fuck Arsenal&#8217;, it&#8217;s Ozil v Emery throughout, and anyone who dares to suggest this wasn&#8217;t just an innocent Tweet expressing his heartfelt love for the club is jumped on. Watch the first few minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M8a7MbYCis&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video by James</a> to get a flavour of what he was accused of for saying this was basically Ozil basically pitting himself against Emery in public.</p> <p>Whether people agree with that or not is up to them but the reality is there in the replies on social media, and even of you want to dismiss it as &#8216;just social media&#8217; and not real life, Ozil – or Ozil and his social media team – sent this message to his 23.8m followers on Twitter, his 31m followers on Facebook, and his 18.7m followers on Instagram with the full knowledge that he has a legion of very passionate fans who are immediately going to side with him. And it&#8217;s one thing if they were all just &#8220;Yes Mesut, we love you&#8221;, there&#8217;s a significant element of that fanbase who will lash out at anyone they perceive to be anti-Ozil.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever known a footballer to have that kind of following before. I genuinely think there are people who support Ozil more than they support Arsenal. And look, we all have our favourite players, but this is certainly a new, somewhat disquieting, phenomenon. It&#8217;s almost like the people who are fans of Beyonce or Taylor Swift who, at anything they consider critical of their Queens, mobilise and round on those who are expressing that opinion. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like with Ozil. If you say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Ozil played well today&#8221; you get stuff like &#8220;Well, you just hate him&#8221;, which is quite the leap. It&#8217;s a simple example, but it happens all the time, and I&#8217;ll tell you who knows this better than anyone – apart from the people who bear the brunt of those fans – it&#8217;s Mesut Ozil and his social media team.</p> <p>They&#8217;re not stupid, they know as well as anyone else how to play the game, and they&#8217;ve helped fashion this PR machine around him so you only ever see the perfect Mesut at all times. And this might be verging on blasphemous to some of his fans, but he&#8217;s not perfect. Like every human being, and every footballer, he&#8217;s got his flaws and some of those are why this situation has arisen this season. Believe it, or don&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s the truth.</p> <p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>: Pointing out somebody is not perfect doesn&#8217;t mean I hate them, it doesn&#8217;t mean I have an agenda against them, it doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m persecuting him: it just makes him a person like everyone else.</p> <p>So, Arsenal lose 1-0 to BATE Borisov, play dreadfully, questions are being asked about Unai Emery, everyone can see we could use more creativity in the team, we have a hugely talented playmaker who didn&#8217;t make the squad and has been on the fringes of the team for months, and at the very least most people would say it couldn&#8217;t have been any worse with Ozil in the team on Thursday night. Fans are frustrated and not enjoying the football we&#8217;re playing, and it&#8217;s obvious that there&#8217;s very public disenchantment.</p> <p>Then Mesut Ozil, or his social media team, or his social media team with the tacit approval of the Mesut Ozil, send out a Tweet – invoking the name of a legendary player that everybody loves – which anyone can see is going to get people wound up. And that&#8217;s exactly what it did. Job done. I assume that&#8217;s what they wanted to do, and it worked. They took advantage of ill-feeling towards the team/manager after terrible result to generate goodwill for Ozil, and if that&#8217;s not the most cynical thing I don&#8217;t know what is.</p> <p>Frankly, I&#8217;m not pro-Ozil or anti-Ozil. He&#8217;s just a player who is massively talented but too often inconsistent. I&#8217;d actually like to see an in-form Ozil in our team because we&#8217;d be better if he was in it and playing well. I&#8217;m not pro or anti-Emery, he&#8217;s a coach who is doing a job I&#8217;m not fully convinced by yet. But here&#8217;s what I definitely am: Pro-Arsenal, and all this has made an already unhealthy situation even more so, and there was no need for it.</p> <p>I also wonder how they think this is going to go down with Emery and the decision makers on the football side of this club. There&#8217;s a very real chance that it could backfire, and make matters more tense and difficult. Make no mistake, Arsenal as an institution can&#8217;t be seen to be weak in this situation, and all the angry Twitter fans in the world won&#8217;t have any influence on team selection, regardless of how loudly they shout.</p> <p>I&#8217;m told that Ozil loves life in London. I don&#8217;t doubt that he has genuine affection for this club, but he and his people have got this one wrong. And if you want to be really hard-boiled about this, looking at football as a business first and foremost, this could be seen as a shot across the Arsenal bows about his future. It&#8217;s telling them that he is in a strong position, he still has two years of his £350,000 a week contract remaining, and that if they want him to go then they&#8217;d better be prepared to cough up or make it worth his while.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve never known a situation like it at this club, and I hope we never see anything like it again because it&#8217;s toxic. If you&#8217;re on Ozil&#8217;s side, good luck to you. I want what&#8217;s best for Arsenal, and the more this goes on, the more publicly it&#8217;s played out, the worse it&#8217;s going to get. It&#8217;s like a festering wound that keeps getting scratched, and it&#8217;s damaging across the board, on the pitch, off the pitch, on the training ground, and online. I know some will respond by saying leaving Ozil out is damaging too, they may have good reason to suggest that during this period of indifferent form, but it goes beyond that in general, and this Tweet did not help one bit.</p> <p>Hopefully there&#8217;s somebody at this club with the strength of character to sort this out one way or the other sooner rather than later, because it&#8217;s going to just get worse otherwise.</p> <p>Till tomorrow, and I suspect I might have a day off Twitter today.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet%2F&#038;title=Arsenal%20the%20collateral%20damage%20of%20the%20Mesut%20Ozil%20Tweet" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsenal-the-collateral-damage-of-the-mesut-ozil-tweet/" data-a2a-title="Arsenal the collateral damage of the Mesut Ozil Tweet"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>Arsenal Gentleman&#8217;s Weekly Review</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 14:10:13 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Arsenal Gent]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Columnists]]></category> <category><![CDATA[arsenal gent]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28341</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GENT18-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />REASONS FOR THE CURRENT ABSOLUTE BLOODY BOLLOCKS UP AT WOOLWICH ARSENAL DEFENCE It’s the worst defence we’ve had in some years.

That Larry Costerley, a 33-year old-who has recently returned from injury, is our rock, really speaks to the failed recruitment policy. At right back we have a kind of multi-purpose midfielder being asked to step into the glass slipper of Harry Bell. It is not that Ainsley Maitland-Niles is bad. No scion of the Hampshire Maitland Niles’ is ever a bad egg. Even Bunny Maitland-Niles, British Expeditionary Force deserter had his moments. I was at Harrow with Pongo Maitland-Niles, and his brother, Catsmeat Maitland-Niles. Both sterling chaps. Young Ainsley is cut from the same cloth. Willing, but easily distracted, and a propensity to forget to do the basic things well. Like passing. His backup in that position is a venerable Swiss grandfather whose only discernible skill is his mastery of the ancient mystical art of Shit-Fu.</p> <p>We currently have a centre half, in the person of Mr. Seamus Masterson, number 20, who cost us somewhere north of 35 million of your guineas. He tackles like Billy Vunipola on psychedelics. He’s on his arse more often than an infant school class in a world record arse-sitting attempt. He slides in like a walrus down a slide at a zoo. I’ve known blind horses that have more positional sense. Every time I read his name on a teamsheet my bottom twitches like a rabbit’s nose. He’s an absolute rotter. He’s not even one of those ‘old fashioned’ players who seems like they’re from another era, like Andy Carroll at West Ham. I’m not sure what era this chap could play in. Or even what dimension.</p> <p>Perhaps there’s an as yet undiscovered planet somewhere, on which they play a version of football, perhaps with a dodecahedron ball, and three goals, on ice, where he would be an acceptable centre-half. It has been long enough now. He needs to be sold, or given away, or perhaps some kind of ‘dunderhead’s dowry’ could be offered to anyone who would take him off our hands. When one finds oneself yearning for the glory days of Igors Stepanovs then one really does have a problem.</p> <h4><span style="color: #cc0000;">TACTICS</span></h4> <p>Do we have any? I mean by Jove, one could forgive the manager for his early season shufflings. But it is now FEBRUARY. We do not know what formation will make an appearance until the match kicks off, and sometimes it’s not even clear then. We seem to have mastered only one attacking move: the Patented Webbley &amp; Collingwood Overlap Manoeuvre. Sometimes it seems as though we are confecting buildup play so we can activate the Patented Webbley &amp; Collingwood Overlap Manoeuvre. I wonder if half time talks consist entirely of the manager talking about the Patented Webbley &amp; Collingwood Overlap Manoeuvre, whilst pointing to a blackboard on which is written ‘The Patented Webbley &amp; Collingwood Overlap Manoeuvre: How to Achieve It’.</p> <h4><span style="color: #cc0000;">ATTACK</span></h4> <p>I don’t just mean the strikers. They seem like thoroughly decent eggs, and Mr. Lakeshead in particular has improved greatly since his arrival. I mean our chronic lack of <em>eGF</em>, or <em>Expected Gentleman’s Favours</em>. We have two thoroughbred strikers who thrive on chances in the box. How many touches in the second half, when we needed a goal, did we have in the box yestereve against the mighty BATE Borisov? 14. FOURTEEN TOUCHES IN TOTAL. I’m not suggesting that we should recall Mr. Orwell, but something has to change. Our reliance on wingbacks to create chances is not working.</p> <p>As the ancient English footballing proverb goes: “If ye cast a wing-back afore’ard twenty times, ye look like a syde going down the shytter.”</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187%2F&#038;title=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-187/" data-a2a-title="Arsenal Gentleman’s Weekly Review"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>BATE Borisov 1-0 Arsenal: Emery blots his copybook with embarrassing defeat</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/bate-borisov-1-0-arsenal-emery-blots-his-copybook-with-embarrassing-defeat/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 06:38:29 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[BATE Borisov 1-0 arsenal]]></category> <category><![CDATA[europa league 2019]]></category> <category><![CDATA[unai emery]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28335</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="BATE Borisov 1-0 Arsenal: Emery blots his copybook with embarrassing defeat" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/emery_borisov2_-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Match report &#8211; Player ratings &#8211; By the numbers &#8211; Video &#8220;What on earth have Arsenal become?&#8221;, asked Amy Lawrence in the opening line of her match report from Belarus last night.

It&#8217;s a question I wish I could answer properly this morning, but if I said we were cautious, one-dimensional and ineffective for most the 1-0 defeat to a team that hasn&#8217;t played a competitive game of football in two months, I think that would be just scratching the surface.</p> <p>Last night was not a hammer blow to our hopes of qualifying for the next round of the Europa League, because we do have the second leg at the Emirates next week, but it was a performance and a result which raises red flags all over the place for me. I understand that this is a squad that needs better players, and I&#8217;ve said more than once that the club&#8217;s failure to back Emery in January after we lost three key players to injury has made an already difficult job even more so, but that team should have been able to win that match comfortably last night, and it didn&#8217;t.</p> <p>By way of contrast, here&#8217;s the team which played Borisov last season – while they were fully match fit and not in the middle of their pre-season preparations too:<em> Ospina, Mustafi, Mertesacker, Holding, Nelson, Wilshere, Elneny, Willock, Maitland-Niles, Walcott, Giroud</em> &#8211; the subs were: <em>Macey, Da Silva, Dragomir, Gilmour, McGuane, Akpom, Nketiah</em>.</p> <p>You can&#8217;t tell me the team we had out last night was worse than that. It was, injuries and out of favour Germans aside, basically the strongest team we could have picked, bearing in mind Aubameyang was just back from illness – but he was still on the bench along with Denis Suarez and Lucas Torreira. There was some depth to what Emery had to work with last night. The team last season scored four times, winning 4-2 in the end – last night&#8217;s returned to London with their tails well and truly between their legs, and rightly so.</p> <p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that it should have been different. Early on Iwobi&#8217;s fantastic pass set Kolasinac free down the left, his low cross should have been converted my Mkhitaryan but he could only hit it straight at the keeper. A bad miss. The Bosnian was our main/only creative threat on the night, and it was his cross to Lacazette which saw the Frenchman fluff his lines and head over. Two glorious chances which would have changed the game, and we couldn&#8217;t take either.</p> <p>Having had a stranglehold on the game early on, it loosened as BATE realised there wasn&#8217;t a great deal of craft to what we were doing – GET KOLASINAC ON THE OVERLAP!!! – and they grew into the game without threatening in any great way. Then Monreal conceded a lazy free kick, what Kolasinac offers as an attacking threat is consistently offset by what he doesn&#8217;t as a defender, and a thumping header which gave Petr Cech no chance put the home side 1-0 up just before the break. It was the eighth time this season that Arsenal have conceded in the five minutes before half-time (via <a href="https://twitter.com/Orbinho/status/1096119782204731400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Orbinho</a>) – no longer can that be viewed as an unfortunate coincidence rather than a fundamental flaw in how this team is being set-up and prepared.</p> <p>There were no half-time changes from Emery, instead the same players did the same stuff. We got it to Kolasinac, he tried a cross, repeat to fade. It almost brought us a goal when Lacazette had the ball in the net but he was just offside, and it was the 69th minute before Aubameyang and Torreira were sent on for Maitland-Niles and Xhaka. We reverted to a back four, and then we sent on Suarez for Kolasinac, went to a back three again and basically everyone looked confused. I don&#8217;t know what Emery&#8217;s plan was, and I&#8217;m no master tactician by any means, but when you have two excellent strikers, I struggle to understand what they were doing picking the ball up on the wings. Perhaps desperation to make something happen because nobody was giving them any service – if only we had a playmaker of some description in our squad – and I&#8217;m pretty sure that frustration played into Lacazette&#8217;s red card.</p> <p>He lashed out and can have no complaints, but it was the 85th minute and he&#8217;s having to make tackles on the halfway line in a game when we need a goal. I don&#8217;t condone what he did but I have some sympathy because it must be a pain in the hole to be a striker in a team which only has one way of creating chances and the manager has taken that player off to put on someone who looks like he&#8217;d be blown over in a stiff breeze. We never looked like scoring the goal which might just have made last night not completely unacceptable, and when the final whistle went the alarm bells started ringing for me.</p> <p>What is Emery doing with this team? Why are we playing three central defenders against opposition like this? What were his substitutions about? Why do we only have one way to create chances? Are the players buying into his methods, because they looked as if they didn&#8217;t really know what they were supposed to be doing? And even in football where bad results happen all the time, how are we supposed to rationalise a defeat to a team as poor as BATE Borisov in the context in which this game has been played?</p> <p>Don&#8217;t talk about the pitch, it&#8217;s the same for both sides, but knowing it&#8217;s a ploughed field, maybe don&#8217;t take intricate short corners which end up doing nothing but pushing us back towards halfway. Is this man not supposed to be renowned for his attention to detail and in-game management? We didn&#8217;t see any of that last night, and I fear that this is a team which isn&#8217;t responding to what he&#8217;s doing. Just over six months into the job, that&#8217;s a real worry, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s even a case that they don&#8217;t want to – I just think the chopping and changing of formations and systems coupled with a deeply cautious outlook makes it hard for them to understand exactly what he wants. There&#8217;s no sign of cohesiveness on the pitch, there hasn&#8217;t been for some time, and each subsequent game does little to suggest any kind of incremental improvement in that regard.</p> <p>Even if you want to dismiss this result as a one-off, can you really shake the worries from the back of your mind about how the rest of the domestic season is going to play out? If we can lose to a team this poor that hasn&#8217;t played since mid-December and whose fitness is far from optimum, we can lose to anyone in the Premier League. And when you consider how we&#8217;re probably going to need somewhere in the region of 30 points from our last 12 games to secure a top four finish, last night&#8217;s performance – from both players and the manager – was very disquieting indeed.</p> <p>Emery said afterwards that he was &#8216;happy&#8217; with the players and their work, which probably makes him about the only man on planet earth with that opinion. I don&#8217;t excuse them from what they produced on the night, but ultimately the man responsible is the one who picks the team and dictates how we&#8217;re going to play – that falls squarely on Unai Emery&#8217;s shoulders.</p> <p>Sometimes you see a performance and a result which, as much as you try and compartmentalise it, creates nagging doubts that are almost impossible to dismiss. Last night was one of those for me. I suspect we&#8217;ll have enough to turn this game around at home next week. As for what lies between now and May, I really have no idea what we&#8217;re going to see, but if we have too many more nights like last night, very serious questions will have to be asked about the direction this club is going in.</p> <p>For more on the game, check out the new Arsecast, recorded last night after the game and I chat to Tim Stillman about what we saw and all the rest.

The squad was announced yesterday afternoon after a medical team update which revealed that four players missing recently <a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/gunners-boosted-by-return-of-four-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were back in full training</a>.</p> <p>Sokratis&#8217; ankle injury was supposed to keep him out until the end of February but he&#8217;s back ahead of schedule; Granit Xhaka&#8217;s groin is all mended; while Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have both recovered from the bout of illness which kept them out of the trip to Huddersfield at the weekend. Good news all round.</p> <p>Then the squad was announced and everyone focused on the fact that there was no Ozil. There was no Sokratis either, it&#8217;s worth pointing out, and <a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/emery-explains-absence-of-sokratis-and-ozil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unai Emery explained their absences</a> at his press conference last night, saying:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;Sokratis only started training yesterday and today – I don’t think it’s enough. Mesut is the same. Aubameyang, after he was sick, trained on Monday, yesterday and today, and I think he’s OK for the match.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Which sounds pretty reasonable really. After being sick does he need a long trip to a freezing cold location to probably sit on the bench for the most part? I don&#8217;t think so, but as ever when it comes to Mesut Ozil there&#8217;s a bit more to it. Other reasons why he might not be in the team:</p> <ul> <li>The board are demanding it of Emery to force him out and not pay him an appearance fee each time he plays</li> <li>Emery hates Ozil</li> <li>Ozil called Emery a &#8216;stinky bum-face&#8217; and Juan Carlos Carcedo over-heard</li> <li>Ozil is tired from playing 3000 hours of Fortnite every week</li> <li>It&#8217;s a day of the week with the letter Y in it</li> <li>The moon is currently waxing</li> <li>Politicians are dickheads</li> <li>There is air</li> <li>who cares?</li> </ul> <p>There is just so much drama every time Ozil is mentioned, and I can completely understand it, but man is it boring now. If there&#8217;s an edict from on high that Emery is to not play him because it costs us more money or because it&#8217;s part of the long-game in convincing him his future lies elsewhere, then the manager is weak. Which is why I can&#8217;t imagine that&#8217;s the case despite that particular theory becoming ever more popular. It&#8217;s not to say I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s some sort of general agreement between Emery and the people running the football side of the club about how Ozil is being used, but if it goes beyond that I&#8217;d be surprised and very, very worried.</p> <p>In time I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get some more insight into what&#8217;s been going on this season, and it feels like there&#8217;s a lot that will come out in the wash one way or the other, but for this evening we&#8217;ve got to go and do job without him – not for the first time this season, or the second time, or the third time, or &#8230; well, you get the picture.</p> <p>Interestingly, of the 18 man squad that travelled to play BATE in September 2017, 12 have either retired, left the club permanently or on loan, with Rob Holding unavailable through injury and youngster Charlie Gilmour not selected. That&#8217;s quite the churn in such a short space of time but it shouldn&#8217;t alter the fact that we&#8217;re well and truly favourites. They haven&#8217;t played a competitive match since December, and anything less than a convincing win for Arsenal tonight would be quite disappointing.</p> <p>Give me a back four with a midfield that can link properly with a three man attack, and let&#8217;s have a go at this lot tonight. There really is no need for a cautious approach against a team like this, even if we are away from home. It sounds a bit like the manager is erring a bit towards that though, as he spoke about tonight&#8217;s opposition in the presser:</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;We can speak about two different situations from them. One is last year they played here and Arsenal won 4-2. The second is thinking about this year when they played in the groups, for example against Chelsea they lost one 1-0 but they had chances to score and to draw in this match.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Yeah, but Bournemouth beat Chelsea 4-0 and Man City beat them 6-0 and we beat them 2-0 so maybe they&#8217;re not all they&#8217;re cracked up to be. Our recent results have been patchy, losing 6 of our last 13 games, and it feels to me like this is a team that needs to build some confidence and momentum. With the return leg next week, then two home games in the Premier League following that, it&#8217;s a good opportunity to do exactly that and it should start tonight with an approach that is positive and aggressive rather than one which worries too much about clearly inferior opposition.</p> <p>Maybe those are famous last words that will come back to haunt me, but I really believe that if we are to have any chance of making the top four, we need to find some decent form and rhythm and tonight&#8217;s game presents a good way of feeding into that. A head of steam before a North London derby early next month would be pretty useful. Let&#8217;s see what happens.</p> <p>As ever we&#8217;ll have a <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live blog</a> for you, and all the post-match stuff on <a href="https://p1r.es/ArseblogNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arseblog News</a> later on too, so join us for that.

Saturday’s 2-1 win at Huddersfield did little to quell the confusion that has bubbled beneath the surface of the Arsenal support since just before Christmas. At the John Smith’s Stadium, Alex Iwobi incurred the wrath of some of that frustration as his substitution was ironically cheered, despite the fact that he had enjoyed a decent enough game.</p> <p>Supporters having their punch bags is not a modern phenomenon. Ask Jon Sammels. While we shouldn’t pretend that Iwobi was relentlessly abused, that he felt the frustration of the away fans generated plenty of discussion online, culminating in Ian Wright recording a video encouraging the fans to be more supportive of an academy product.</p> <p><iframe width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1NJfRE5zXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>There is a debate to be had as to whether academy products deserve special treatment from supporters. Generally speaking, players reared by the club are afforded a little more leeway than their counterparts- as evidenced by Jack Wilshere last season. Jack’s performances were rarely above mediocre (for reasons that are both well documented and not entirely his fault), but still the crowd chased the ghost of his diminished potential.</p> <p>Of course nobody has to rate Alex Iwobi against their will. It is easy to see why he frustrates. His end product needs to improve, as <a href="https://www.football365.com/news/emery-implores-arsenal-man-to-be-calm-amid-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his manager acknowledged</a> in the wake of the Huddersfield match. Iwobi has other skills in the build-up phase that are incredibly useful to Arsenal and a little subtler to appreciate. But he is not a world beater at the moment, he splits opinion for reasons that are not difficult to understand and some people like him more than others.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I agree with this ^ and also because he&#39;s good at different stuff to what people think he should be good at</p> <p>&mdash; Michael Cox (@Zonal_Marking) <a href="https://twitter.com/Zonal_Marking/status/1092447433236320258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2019</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>However, the ‘conversation’ over the ‘treatment’ meted out to Iwobi accelerated when <a href="https://arseblog.com/2019/01/ainsley-maitland-trials__trashed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a> felt the need (perhaps ironically) to respond to comments on his Instagram page from doubtless august critics.

It will come down to the quality of the coaching and how well handled they are. It will also come down to the players themselves, whether they are able to make the most of opportunities and how well they listen to their coaches.

There is a grey area we can observe between ‘happy clappy’ and vitriolic.</p> <p>Obviously, the mental fortitude of any young player will need to be steely enough to withstand criticism if they are to become Arsenal vintage, but nobody benefits if we make that examination more difficult for them.

Callum Hudson-Odoi wanted to leave Chelsea in January because he doesn’t believe Stamford Bridge is the environment to hone his talent. Young players are beginning to look at the Bundesliga favourably, while the successes of Trent Alexander Arnold and Joe Gomez at Liverpool and the integration of Harry Winks at Spurs makes those destinations attractive for young talent. Arsenal need to rediscover that brand for developing young talent and we the fans have a small part to play in creating those conditions.</p> <p>In my piece from a fortnight ago, I speculated that the ennui in the stands was partially down to the loss of several cult heroes. Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere have all left in the past year. The likes of Santi Cazorla, Per Mertesacker, Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Alexis Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, Wojciech Szczesny and Kieran Gibbs have also recently exited.</p> <p>The confirmation of Aaron Ramsey’s summer departure to Juventus sees the club’s longest serving player- now a high level rotation option- depart. Carl Jenkinson is the sole survivor of the famed ‘British core’, which now takes on the appearance of a black and white photo of your grandparents when they were children. Meanwhile, Mesut Özil has been frozen out, while Nacho Monreal, Danny Welbeck and Hector Bellerin have suffered fitness wise- as Laurent Koscielny did earlier in the campaign. In short, it’s a swiftly assembled and unfamiliar team.</p> <p>The likes of Kolasinac, Xhaka, Mkhitaryan and probably Iwobi are players that we haven’t quite figured out yet. Ramsey, Giroud and Walcott went through various phases of ignominy with the Arsenal support before we became accustomed to and indeed fond of them. The current squad have yet to transition into that phase and the next few transfer windows promise further churn.</p> <p>But underneath the surface, a core is beginning to form. The two outstanding performers on a fairly unmemorable day in Manchester earlier this month were Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira. The Uruguayan has been an instant hit with Arsenal fans and, helpfully, his name rhymes with “Vieira”, making it easy to voice that appreciation.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Sven Mislintat was indeed responsible for recruiting Guendouzi and Torreira, what a great shame that he’s going</p> <p>&mdash; Alan Smith (@9smudge) <a href="https://twitter.com/9smudge/status/1092108317466472448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Don’t underestimate the value of a catchy, easy song when assessing a player’s popularity. It is one of the big reasons Giroud’s popularity grew in his final years at the club. Matteo Guendouzi hasn’t quite had the same level of tuneful recognition, thanks in part to the fact that his name is difficult to parse in the terrace songbook.</p> <p>He is perhaps one of those players we have struggled to work out. Guendouzi is an all-rounder, whereas Torreira’s gifts are more defined and include qualities the team has missed for many years. But I think Guendouzi’s popularity will grow as his all action performances become more consistent. With his Sideshow Bob hairdo and his cocksure personality, he has the ingredients of folk heroism.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First good video I&#39;ve seen on Guendouzi. Highlights how good he is at a variety of things <a href="https://t.co/Zgdwv3LXjV">https://t.co/Zgdwv3LXjV</a></p> <p>&mdash; CD14 (@c_d_14) <a href="https://twitter.com/c_d_14/status/1094896809439305730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>Likewise, Alex Lacazette’s industrious displays upfront have been met with widespread approval. At 27, I would imagine the club are keen to open contract talks with him in the coming months. If Arsenal can keep hold of him, he certainly has the potential to be the doyen of the North Bank. It takes time to build that kind of rapport and, hopefully, in time the likes of Iwobi and Maitland-Niles, as well as Nelson and Smith-Rowe, can form the core of a team that Arsenal fans can take to their hearts.</p> <p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Stillberto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Stillberto</a>&#8211; Or like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stillberto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&amp;linkname=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fwe-could-be-heroes%2F&#038;title=We%20Could%20Be%20Heroes" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/we-could-be-heroes/" data-a2a-title="We Could Be Heroes"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>How to approach the first leg of our Europa League tie</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/how-to-approach-the-first-leg-of-our-europa-league-tie/</link> <pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 07:11:06 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[BATE Borisov v Arsenal 2019]]></category> <category><![CDATA[europa league]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28315</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/europa_league_ball-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />As the others get on with their piffling Champions League adventures, Arsenal are getting ready for the competition that really matters: The Europa League.

The Champions League is full of teams who aren&#8217;t champions, but the Europa League is made up entirely of European teams or teams who enjoy The Final Countdown by Europe so it is a much purer experience.</p> <p>I did watch a bit of Man Utd v PSG last night. They lost, which is always kinda fun, but I do wonder if, from an Arsenal point of view, it might be good for us if they were to go a bit deeper and thus have to deal with midweek football a bit longer. They&#8217;re one of our big rivals for the top four, probably the favourites based on recent form, so anything that causes them fatigue and potential injuries could be useful. They&#8217;ll go to Paris for the second leg without the suspended Paul Pogba though, so I think their chances are pretty slim.</p> <p>Also, Alexis Sanchez looks so knackered and so far from what we remember him as when he played for us that a goal at the Emirates next month feels more inevitable than it usually does when we face a former player who has already returned and scored a goal against us this season. Thankfully though, the Aubameyang hat-trick at the other end will render it a consolation, and the Chilean will go home and sing Richard Marx songs at his dogs who will look at each other and sigh but they&#8217;ll still love him because dogs are the best.</p> <p>Anyway, as I said Arsenal are preparing for a trip to Belarus to play BATE Borisov. We played them last season and scored 10 goals in the two group stages we played against them. They&#8217;re so bad that even Mohamed Elneny scored – quite a good goal if I remember correctly. Which is why, if it were me, I would play the strongest team I could on Thursday night.</p> <p><strong>Reason 1</strong>: We don&#8217;t have a game this weekend, so even though there&#8217;s a flight and some road travel involved, the players who go will have plenty of time to recover from their first class flight in which they can lie down anyway. Do a good job over there, then have another week of rest and recharging the batteries. It&#8217;d be like a mid-season break except not in some warm weather resort.</p> <p><strong>Reason 2</strong>: A strong team could win the game comprehensively and thus for the second leg we could play a team of fringe and young players, which would allow Unai Emery to rest his most important players ahead of the Southampton game the following Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Reason 3</strong>: I don&#8217;t need a third reason. I am already convinced by my own hypothesis.</p> <p>So, what kind of a team could we see tomorrow night. How about:</p> <p><em>Cech, Lichtsteiner, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal, Torriera, Guendouzi, Ramsey, Iwobi, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang</em></p> <p>On the bench you&#8217;d have Lacazette, Suarez and Ozil to come on and hammer some more nails in their proverbial coffin, then for the second leg you could play something like:</p> <p><em>Cech, Lichtsteiner, Mustafi, Medley, Kolasinac, Willock, A chair, Inanimate Carbon Rod, Ozil, Suarez, Nketiah</em>.</p> <p>Of course all this is dependent on us winning the first leg as well as we&#8217;d like. Will Unai Emery go for it, or will we be cautious? Knowing Emery a little now, I&#8217;d say we might go for it, but in a cautious manner. Not so much UP AND AT &#8216;EM as ARISE GENTLY AND MOVE SLOWLY BUT ASSUREDLY TOWARDS THEM BUT NOT IN A WAY THAT MIGHT STARTLE THEM.</p> <p>We&#8217;ll have more on that game tomorrow when we know what kind of squad we&#8217;ve taken and when we&#8217;ve heard from Emery in his pre-game press conference which takes place this eebening.</p> <p>For those wondering about the fitness of some of the chaps who missed out on the Huddersfield trip, I can assure you that both Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mesut Ozil appear to be recovered from their illnesses. Both of them appeared on a live Arsenal YouTube thing yesterday in which they were asked questions like: Who should you not sit beside on the team bus?</p> <p>Ozil answered: &#8216;Musti&#8217;, although both of them said he was the best DJ in the squad because he plays a lot of German rap music. With all due respect to aficionados of that particular genre, I don&#8217;t think that would get him my vote. The point is that Ozil is alive and apparently well, so let&#8217;s see if he&#8217;s in the squad to travel today. Hopefully Emery doesn&#8217;t consider BATE Borisov to be the Belarusian Bournemouth, and thus too physical for him, but we&#8217;ll see soon enough.</p> <p>Finally, after the details of his summer move to Italy were revealed, the Juventus sporting director says that Arsenal never used Aaron Ramsey in his best position. According to Fabio Paratici:</p> <blockquote><p>Ramsey is a player who, in my opinion, has never found his position, because he has never played as a ‘mezzala’ in a three, which is his role.</p></blockquote> <p>What exactly is a &#8216;mezzala&#8217;? Well, <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/127534/just-what-mezzala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Football Italia</a>:</p> <p><em>It is, we are told, a new role, a product of the modern innovations in Serie A. The role of this player is variable: some believe he is a box-to-box midfielder with special duties, others argue that he must overlap with the winger, and a few provide detailed, convoluted explanations of the passing geometries that a player must engage in to belong to that exclusive Italian club.</em></p> <p><em>The term mezzala, in contemporary Italian, indicates a position in a three-man midfield. Thus, in a 4-3-3, the central spot in the midfield will usually be occupied by a playmaker (regista), flanked by two mezzale. If the simplicity of the definition feels anti-climactic, that&#8217;s because it should: a mezzala is simply any midfielder playing on one of the two sides in a three-man midfield.</em></p> <p>So, there you go. And yes, it is anti-climactic. He&#8217;s a midfielder. Right, that&#8217;s it for today.

Arsenal fans have been put through the absolute wringer by their team. 2-0 down to Hull City inside 9 minutes of our first FA Cup final since 2005, and it was almost 3-0 but thankfully Kieran Gibbs headed a goal-bound header off the line.</p> <p>Santi Cazorla pulled one back with a glorious free kick, and Laurent Koscielny scored the most Laurent Koscielny goal to level it in the second half. Gibbs missed a brilliant chance to win it in normal time, but blasted over the bar and into extra-time we went. Giroud hit the crossbar, we looked like the team most likely to score but when you know Arsenal as well as we do that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re not also the team most likely to concede.</p> <p>The second period of extra-time. Yaya Sanogo is causing ripples in the space-time continuum with his mere presence, but then we work the ball into the box, Giroud backheels it and there&#8217;s Aaron Ramsey to apply the finish and we&#8217;re 3-2 up. Pandemonium. Joy. Relief. Hope. 119th minute terror when Fabianski comes out and they put the ball just wide but in the end the Welshman&#8217;s goal is enough and Arsenal win the cup.</p> <p>The trophy drought is over. Nine years, that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got. 9 years, my brain hurts a lot. I still have goosebumps writing about it this morning, because it was one of the best days ever. Stick your &#8216;It&#8217;s only the FA Cup&#8217; right up your bum. It meant so much. It meant so much celebrating, sticky floors in the Tollington, hugs and Arsenal love. It meant so much of a hangover. But all of it was worth it and I&#8217;d do it again tomorrow.</p> <p>Or in 2017 when Chelsea had just scored a stupid goal and before we&#8217;d even really had a chance for that to sink in Giroud did it again, providing the pass for Ramsey to head home and make it 2-1 and hahahaha John Terry going up the steps to collect his loser medal and loving Rob Holding and Per Mertesacker and Nacho Monreal but also the man who scored the winner in the cup final for the second time.</p> <p>Frankly I don&#8217;t care what way other people want to define the term legend, it&#8217;s never going to be something that everyone agrees on, but for my money the player who helped crown two of the best days out I&#8217;ve ever had as an Arsenal fan can wear that t-shirt all day long as far as I&#8217;m concerned. If he doesn&#8217;t meet your criteria, that&#8217;s fine. Don&#8217;t @ me – especially if you&#8217;ve just read the headline and not the article – and sorry bro I&#8217;ll take it into consideration but he ticks the boxes for me.</p> <p>And yesterday it was confirmed that he&#8217;ll be a Juventus player next season:</p> <p><em><strong>Turin, 11 February 2019</strong> – Juventus Football Club S.p.A. announces that a contract of employment with the player Aaron James Ramsey, effective as of 1st July 2019 and expiring on 30 June 2023, has been signed. As a result of the registration of the player, Juventus will incur additional costs of € 3.7 million, to be paid within 10th July 2019.</em></p> <p><a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/aaron-ramsey-sends-message-to-fans-after-juventus-deal-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron James Ramsey also provided a message for the fans</a>:</p> <p><em>As you may have already heard, I have agreed a pre-contract with Juventus Football Club. </em></p> <p><em>I wanted to issue a personal statement for all the Arsenal fans who have been extremely loyal and supportive. You welcomed me as a teenager and have been there for me through all the highs and lows I’ve encountered during my time at the club.

Thank you. </em></p> <p><em>I will continue to give the team 100% and hope to finish the season strongly, before heading on to my next chapter in Turin.</em></p> <p><em>Kind regards, </em><br /> <em><strong>Aaron</strong></em></p> <p>Is that not the most Ramsey statement of all time? Kind regards!</p> <p><em>Please have the financial reports on my desk first thing in the morning.</em></p> <p><em>Kind regards, </em><br /> <em><strong>Aaron</strong></em></p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p><em>I am unable to attend the parent-teacher meeting this evening because I have very bad diarrhea.</em></p> <p><em>Kind regards, </em><br /> <em><strong>Aaron</strong></em></p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p><em>Your workplace behaviour has been below par for some time now. Please make more of an effort or we will have to take this to HR.</em></p> <p><em>Kind regards, </em><br /> <em><strong>Aaron</strong></em></p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>I thought the <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/club-statement-aaron-ramsey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal statement was a bit flat</a>, all things considered. He&#8217;s been here for 11 years, suffered a dreadful injury, but leaves the club&#8217;s highest scoring central midfielder of all time with two FA Cup winners to his name, and it sort of continues a recent them in which club statements lack the kind of personal touch we had previously seen. Maybe we need a new Head of Press Releases.</p> <p>Anyway, the point is he&#8217;s going and according to reports is going to earn a massive salary in Italy next season. Of course part of the reason his salary is so big is because he&#8217;s available for free, the signing-on fee he&#8217;ll be paid will likely be spread out over the course of his contract on top of his basic wage, and he&#8217;s got a fantastic deal for himself. He&#8217;ll play for one of the biggest clubs in Europe, have a genuine chance of winning the title there, and will be back in the Champions League with a team that can be competitive in that competition.</p> <p>I think the fact that clubs like Juventus and Real Madrid were interested tells you a lot about his quality, and in England there was definite interest from Chelsea and in particular Manchester United which he eschewed to go abroad. He could just as easily have signed for another English club but didn&#8217;t, so there&#8217;s another little tick in the right boxes for me.</p> <p>From an Arsenal point of view we&#8217;re losing a very good player for free and however you want to look at it that&#8217;s bad business, particularly when he&#8217;ll be followed out the door by Danny Welbeck this summer who will also leave without us receiving a single penny. It&#8217;s a situation we should have dealt with earlier, as unpopular as it might have been, but at the same time I understand it&#8217;s complicated.</p> <p>Wenger had just left, Unai Emery spoke keenly about working with Ramsey when he first arrived, and selling one of the club&#8217;s best players during a summer of intense change and turmoil wouldn&#8217;t have been easy. I think we thought we could convince him to stay the way we did with Ozil and Walcott in similar situations, but it wasn&#8217;t to be. There was a contract offered, it wasn&#8217;t signed, it was withdrawn. It&#8217;s far from ideal but then I don&#8217;t think anyone could quite have predicted Ramsey&#8217;s departure would also coincide with the mess that is the Ozil situation too.</p> <p>Over the years Ramsey hasn&#8217;t perhaps hit the heights as consistently as we&#8217;d have hoped, but man he scored some amazing goals for us. That Galatasaray hit with his left foot into the top corner is one of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen, and there&#8217;s a highlight reel out there for the Arsenal video making community to get on top of. What I liked most about him though was the fact he never hid on the pitch. Even during periods when things weren&#8217;t going well for him and the crowd was on his back at times, he believed fully in himself and his ability to produce for the team.</p> <p>We&#8217;re losing a really good player, one we&#8217;re going to have to replace without the benefit of a fee commensurate with his talent, and that makes an already difficult summer even more so. There is still the possibility of one more cup final before the end though.</p> <p><strong>May 2019</strong>: The 89th minute in Baku, Azerbaijan: the ball breaks to Ramsey on the edge of the box &#8230; what a way that would be to say goodbye. A cup final winning goal hat-trick. I know it&#8217;s a long-shot, but then so was that one against Galatasaray &#8230;</p> <p>Till tomorrow.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&amp;linkname=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Faaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me%2F&#038;title=Aaron%20Ramsey%20heads%20for%20Italy%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20an%20Arsenal%20legend%20to%20me" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/aaron-ramsey-heads-for-italy-and-hes-an-arsenal-legend-to-me/" data-a2a-title="Aaron Ramsey heads for Italy and he’s an Arsenal legend to me"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>City kick us up a place + thoughts on Maitland-Niles/Iwobi abuse</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/city-kick-us-up-a-place-thoughts-on-maitland-niles-iwobi-abuse/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 06:57:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Ainsley Maitland-Niles]]></category> <category><![CDATA[alex iwobi]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28294</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="City kick us up a place + thoughts on Maitland-Niles/Iwobi abuse" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amn_ai17-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Morning all, welcome to a brand new week.

My German Shepherd shaped alarm clock got me up at 5.45am, and here were are. What&#8217;s different between today and yesterday? Well, yesterday we were in sixth place in the Premier League and today we&#8217;re in fifth thanks to Man City&#8217;s annihilation of Chelsea at the Etihad yesterday.</p> <p>Our goal difference is now the same (+16) but we go above them by virtue of having scored more goals (53 to 45). Chelsea have now been beaten in their last three away games. 2-0 by Arsenal, 4-0 by Bournemouth and 6-0 by Man City. I look forward to their next away fixture at Fulham when Calum Chambers will score a double hat-trick as they win 8-0. That&#8217;s the next one in the sequence, right?</p> <p>Having been on the receiving end of a few scorelines like that in recent years, we understand how unpleasant it is. Which is why, when you see it happening to somebody else, it&#8217;s downright hilarious. The outpouring of anger from Chelsea fans on Twitter, handily searchable via the <em>#sarriout</em> hashtag, was fantastic and provided us with some fun on <a href="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsecast-extra-episode-270-10-02-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new Arsecast Extra</a> which we recorded last night. I was just sad City didn&#8217;t score ten, and if this is the kind of result which helps destabilise one of our rivals for the top four, then that&#8217;s an added bonus.</p> <p>It will be almost two weeks before we play again in the Premier League. This weekend is FA Cup weekend, we&#8217;re not in it so it&#8217;ll be Sunday week before we face Southampton at the Emirates. In the meantime there are two Europa League fixtures against BATE Borisov to contend with. The away leg comes this Thursday, the home one the week after, and we&#8217;ll have plenty of time to discuss those games in the very near future.</p> <p>So, what have we got to sink our teeth into this morning? I don&#8217;t know that the Huddersfield game needs any more analysis, but in the wake of that the issue of players being abused via social media has raised its ugly head again:</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The criticism of Ainsley Maitland-Niles on social media is absolutely disgraceful. He’s a young player who’s played out of position on numerous occasions, he’s never complained and always give his best for the team. How about trying to support the youn players! <a href="https://t.co/yaFtyMUDmB">pic.twitter.com/yaFtyMUDmB</a></p> <p>&mdash; Stuart MacFarlane (@Stuart_PhotoAFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stuart_PhotoAFC/status/1094589954552987650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>If you didn&#8217;t see this in any detail, Maitland-Niles took abuse on his Instagram account in the comments, even responding to some in a fairly pithy way, but it&#8217;s an issue that this direct access to players causes. It&#8217;s not just a football thing either, anybody with any kind of public profile is open to it, but in the case of a young player who posted a picture from a game in which he provided a great assist it&#8217;s depressing that there are people out there who see it as their right to ridicule or abuse him. His performance was mixed, no question, but he&#8217;s a young player in the fledgling stages of his top flight career yet there seems to be no understanding of that.</p> <p>This is the double-edged sword of social media. It allows us to interact with people we never could have previously unless you happened to meet them face to face. If you run into a footballer in the supermarket you&#8217;re far less likely to tell him you think he&#8217;s terrible, or decide he can only improve with the valuable coaching advice you can impart having played FIFA and Championship Manager your entire life. Online though, we know people behave differently, a cloak of anonymity is often the shield used, but I don&#8217;t think we can escape the fundamental conclusion that it also allows arseholes to be arseholes.</p> <p>This doesn&#8217;t mean players are somehow exempt from criticism, nor does it mean that fans aren&#8217;t entitled to an opinion. It&#8217;s just that if you go online, tag in a player on his Twitter or reply to them with abuse on whatever platform they&#8217;re using, it means you&#8217;re an arsehole. It&#8217;s not as if there aren&#8217;t all kinds of ways you can discuss games, performances, players, the manager without involving them.</p> <p>I do wonder what these people hope to achieve. First and foremost, I hope players understand that it&#8217;s not reflective of the way most reasonable fans think, but has Ainsley Maitland-Niles pondered over a comment this weekend from Stevie84756651 and thought, &#8220;Yes, this random and seemingly furious Internet stranger is correct in what he says about my game. I will do what he says and that will make me a better player&#8221;? I doubt it very much.</p> <p>Apparently, Alex Iwobi was jeered by the Arsenal fans when he was substituted at Huddersfield. He scored our first goal, worked really hard all day, and while not everything he did came off and he could certainly have done better with the final ball on a couple of occasions, he was about our only outlet in that dismal second period when we could barely get out of our own half. I understand frustration with elements of his game, but I struggle to understand why an Arsenal lad, who has been at the club since the age of 9 and made his way through all the levels to the first team, has become the lightning rod for that kind of stuff.</p> <p>He&#8217;s still only 22, to my mind he has improved this season, and is being asked to do a difficult job as the man to link seven defensive players to one or two attacking ones. He&#8217;s not perfect, he can definitely improve, but he&#8217;s not picking himself and it&#8217;s not his fault that the squad just doesn&#8217;t seem to have anyone else who can do that job. He&#8217;s not being picked ahead of Ozil because that&#8217;s not where the German plays or what he does when he is in the team.</p> <p>The player is the public facing side of this situation, so I suppose that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s easy to to target him. I&#8217;d be far more inclined to be critical of the lack of investment in the squad which means that Iwobi has to play week in, week out when he could certainly benefit from having competition and the team itself could use an injection of quality anyway. He&#8217;s the wrong target because he tries hard, he&#8217;s not unproductive either, and that the sights are turned on an Arsenal academy graduate rather than the people running the club the way it&#8217;s being run seems sad to me.</p> <p>Anyway, there&#8217;s plenty of discussion of this topic and much more on the Arsecast Extra.

In my preview of the game I spoke about wanting to see Arsenal really have a go against a team who have won just twice this season, but clearly the players we had missing informed Unai Emery&#8217;s approach which was to sit off them and then hit on the counter.</p> <p>I suppose given that we took three points we can say it worked, but it wasn&#8217;t particularly pleasing on the eye and over the course of the 90 minutes Huddersfield had more of the ball, made more passes, enjoyed greater territory than us, had more attempts on goal, more attempts on target, and while I fully accept the manager&#8217;s options were limited yesterday, I found the way we played difficult to enjoy.</p> <p>The win? No complaints. We needed the points because United had won earlier at Fulham, a pretty convincing 3-0 win at one of the Premier League&#8217;s bottom teams, so above all else we had a job to do yesterday and we did it. You can argue that this is all that counts, and I can see that point of view. At the end of the day the most important thing is the result, and I also understand that we&#8217;re a team that hadn&#8217;t won away since November and ultimately Emery&#8217;s target yesterday was to take three points. On that basis, the job was done.</p> <p>The goals came from Alex Iwobi, who got a bit of luck when his volley from a Sead Kolasinac cross to the back post deflected off the defender and wrong-footed the keeper. It wasn&#8217;t an easy one for him to get on target though, so he was rewarded for his technique. The second came via good work from Mkhitaryan, then a great low cross from Maitland-Niles, and Alexandre Lacazette was there to apply the close range finish. 2-0 before half-time.</p> <p>Generally speaking it was pretty comfortable, but then we were playing a team who have scored just 13 goals in the league this season so it was hardly as if we were going to be under the cosh. Our five defenders and two defensive midfielders weren&#8217;t overly troubled, even if we needed Laurent Koscielny to be at his best. One brilliant intervention when Leno pushed a save straight out in front of him prevented Huddersfield from making it 2-1 in the 72nd minute. Given our ability to concede at any moment – as evidenced late in the game when Kolasinac scored an own goal – I think that was a fairly pivotal moment.</p> <p>We had chances we didn&#8217;t make the most of, the final ball to Lacazette was never quite right, much to his increasing frustration, but never once could you have said we had control of the game. Our passing was awful, Kolasinac completed just 55% of his passes which is horrendous at this level. The more the game went on the more isolated Lacazette became up front and we found it hard to get out of our own half &#8230; against the team bottom of the league who have won twice all season and scored just 13 goals.</p> <p>Maybe this was all Emery&#8217;s plan, to sit off and trust that even our defence could cope with an attack so ineffective. If so, I guess it worked, but it wasn&#8217;t much fun to look at. Some will ask, do you want to win or do you want to be entertained? First and foremost I want to win, of course, like every fan does, but it&#8217;s not a crime to suggest that the football we played yesterday, and the football we&#8217;ve seen in general this season hasn&#8217;t been particularly enjoyable. During the 22 match unbeaten run it&#8217;s fair to say that most of the games were ground out to extent rather than convincing performances in which we dominated the games.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the case that Emery simply doesn&#8217;t have the players to play more attractive football. Perhaps yesterday there&#8217;s more mitigation to make that argument, but let&#8217;s remember we set up exactly the same way a few weeks ago against another of the league&#8217;s struggling sides, and until we were awarded a penalty against Cardiff in the 66th minute we hadn&#8217;t managed a shot on target. I get that a team without Ramsey, Ozil and Aubameyang is limited, but should that really see Arsenal play the way we did yesterday against Huddersfield?</p> <p>I know we&#8217;ve had flashes this season when we play well, but I think those performances are often married with a kind of ambition we don&#8217;t see often enough. Fulham away is held up as a gold-standard for &#8216;Emeryball&#8217;, but on that day we played an offensive 4-2-2-2 formation, we had Ramsey and Aubameyang to come off the bench and the substitutes made a big difference that day. Sp*rs and Liverpool at home, we played with real intent and were rewarded. Leicester at home saw our most talented player pull the strings.</p> <p>Generally though, there&#8217;s a conservatism and caution to the way Emery sets up his team which feels inhibiting to our performances. I understand fine well that we have defensive issues which would give any manager nightmares, but also we have a lot of attacking talent in this squad which I don&#8217;t think we use well enough to help us control games. I know it&#8217;s going to take him time and another transfer window or two to get his team the way he wants it, but even with that I can&#8217;t help wonder how different his methods will be. Time will tell, I guess, and until then Arsenal&#8217;s performances are things to be endured rather than enjoyed.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t know if this is just something we have to get used to now, a manager who is more functional than the man who came before, but Wenger built his legacy on attractive, attacking football. It fell by the wayside as his powers waned in the latter years, and there wasn&#8217;t much to enjoy about the way we played in the last couple of seasons either, but you knew what he was about. We&#8217;re still trying to work out the new man, and as I said there are all kinds of mitigating circumstances, but maybe what we saw yesterday against Huddersfield is the essence of Emery – someone who values the result above style of play, rather than someone whose style helps his team achieve results.</p> <p>I think there&#8217;s a bigger discussion to be had about how important a team&#8217;s style of play is. How it can inspire a crowd, how it generates interest, garners new fans, instills belief in players and their ability to perform on a consistent basis, and ultimately how it shapes the perception of your club. It can make it attractive to players who want to come and play for you, and from a commercial point of view which is fundamental in this day and age. To say it doesn&#8217;t matter is wrong, it really does, but maybe that&#8217;s a post for another day or for a podcast chat.</p> <p>All that said, we&#8217;re now just one point off fourth placed Man Utd. Chelsea play Man City today so we could do with them dropping some points, and our next two games are at home against Southampton then Bournemouth so there&#8217;s a good chance to build some momentum in the next couple of weeks. We do have two Europa League games before our next Premier League one though, so the attention can turn to that competition over the coming days.</p> <p>Right, that&#8217;s your lot for this morning. James and I are recording the Arsecast Extra a bit later on this evening, so we may have that podcast available tonight but if not it&#8217;ll be out first thing Monday morning.</p> <p>Have a great Sunday.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&amp;linkname=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fhuddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again%2F&#038;title=Huddersfield%201-2%20Arsenal%3A%20Unai%20Emery%E2%80%99s%20side%20win%20ugly%20again" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/huddersfield-1-2-arsenal-unai-emerys-side-win-ugly-again/" data-a2a-title="Huddersfield 1-2 Arsenal: Unai Emery’s side win ugly again"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>Huddersfield v Arsenal &#8211; live blog</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/huddersfield-v-arsenal-live-blog/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2019 14:06:01 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arsenal live blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[arsenal team news]]></category> <category><![CDATA[huddersfield v arsenal]]></category> <category><![CDATA[premier league 2019]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28282</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="ARSENAL LIVE BLOG" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LIVE2019-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Join us this afternoon for live blog coverage of our Premier League clash against Huddersfield &#8211; kick off 15.00 We&#8217;ve got up the second live text commentary, updates, goal clips, observations and occasionally witty asides.

They sit well and truly bottom of the table with 11 points, and on paper it&#8217;s the kind of game we should win comfortably.</p> <p>A large part of me thinks we will take three points today, although I don&#8217;t necessarily expect it to be comfortable, but there&#8217;s definitely another part of me that worries that we might Arsenal it up in a very Arsenal way. Our recent away form doesn&#8217;t help in that regard, 2 points from the last 18 is dismal, and that run includes defeats at West Ham and Southampton, as well as a draw against Brighton.</p> <p>Today is a chance to improve that record and it&#8217;s followed by two home games so it&#8217;s a chance to get points on the board and start building momentum ahead of the North London derby early next month. Now, what is Emery going to do with his team today? The honest answer is I don&#8217;t have a clue.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t know what formation we&#8217;re going to play. There are questions over who will be involved in various positions that I&#8217;m not sure I can answer. Emery is a bit of a Kinder Egg manager – inside every game there&#8217;s an underwhelming surprise, like a little plastic Mustafi.</p> <p>Who will play right back or right wing back today? Don&#8217;t know. It could be Lichtsteiner. It could be Carl Jenkinson. It could be Mustafi if we bring in Mavropanos into the centre of defence which is something I&#8217;d like to see, <a href="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/oh-yes-im-the-greek-defender-ooh-ooh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I wrote yesterday</a>. Whichever way you want to look at it the options aren&#8217;t great, but it should be manageable for a game like today.</p> <p>In midfield I&#8217;m sure Matteo Guendouzi will play because Emery loves him some Matteo Guendouzi, and we can all see why. Lucas Torreira, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Denis Suarez, Alex Iwobi, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are all available to him, so take your pick there, and given most of our goals this season have come from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette I think we&#8217;ll see both of them start again. Interestingly (or you might feel another word is appropriate here), despite picking up a serious injury in early November, Danny Welbeck remains our third highest scorer this season with &#8230; 5.</p> <p>I know Emery has often been a bit conservative, particularly away from home, but it would be disappointing today if we didn&#8217;t pick a team that was set up to have a real go against a side who have conceded 46 goals this season and scored just 13. You always have to respect the opposition and I&#8217;m not suggesting we need to just turn up and go through the motions to win, rather let&#8217;s trust the quality of the attacking/creative players we have in our squad and play this game on the front foot right from the first whistle.</p> <p>We&#8217;re not particularly great at the back, something Emery admitted this week, but let&#8217;s not try and make ourselves more solid there at the expense of our attacking potency. It&#8217;s one thing playing that way against one of the other big teams in the league who have the kind of goal threat you can&#8217;t ignore, but we&#8217;re facing a team nailed on for relegation, and that should inform both our approach and team selection today.</p> <p>&#8212;</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/08/arsenal-outsiders-chase-champions-league-unai-emery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emery says of our top four hopes</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Are we outsiders for fourth place? Now, yes. Because we are sixth. It’s practical but it is like that. I trust in our capacity to take fourth but it is like that. There are teams now that are better than us and who have an advantage to us.</p> <p>Chelsea and Manchester United, two very big teams &#8230; they are closer than us. We need to continue thinking to be in the top four but knowing it’s difficult. It’s not to think we’re playing under pressure – it’s to be demanding and with the ambition to be in the top four, also knowing other teams have an advantage to us.</p></blockquote> <p>I wonder about these remarks a bit. Is it a case that he&#8217;s trying to take pressure off his players by categorising us/them as underdogs? Is it simply an inelegant way of addressing the reality of the situation due to his level of English right now? I suspect it might well be that, but at the same time it comes off a bit as if we&#8217;re some kind of minnows who are desperately trying to hang onto the coat-tails of the big boys.</p> <p>I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say there&#8217;s a bit of an inferiority complex about those quotes, but they&#8217;re certainly at odds with how we&#8217;re used to our manager talking about his team. Wenger would always publicly talk up the quality of his players, even at times when we knew what he was saying wasn&#8217;t reflected by the squad he had or the performances they put in, so maybe it&#8217;s just a more pragmatic approach coupled with an inability right now to express himself as well as he can in a new language.</p> <p>You could argue that in terms of investment, stature, squads and recent achievements that both Man Utd and Chelsea are &#8216;better&#8217; than us, but with a league game upcoming against the former and the latter potential Europa League opponents at some point, I do wonder about saying it so publicly.</p> <p>To be fair, I suspect many fans would share his view that in terms of the top four, we are outsiders, and that it will take something a bit special between now and May to achieve that goal with the squad he has, so maybe it&#8217;s just me being a bit sensitive.

You may remember me from such movies as No Goals for Celta Vigo B, Seven Glorious Strikes for Barcelona B, Loan Vengeance: Sevilla, 2012: Etihad Judgement Day, The Realest Real Deal at Villareal: Competence Near Valencia and Bit Part Part VI: Barcelona A.</p> <p>Now I have brought my relative competence as a midfielder to Arsenal Football Club, and I am determined to write my place in the history of this great club between February 2019 and May 2019.</p> <p>I have a number of things going for me. First of all, my name is Denis. Not Dennis, you understand, but it’s close enough to make Arsenal fans angry and wistful about a time when they actually used to win titles. My other name is Suarez, which also brings back memories of a hilariously botched Arsenal transfer. But hey, at least my loan fee was £2,170,000, and not £2,170,001, eh Gooners? Perhaps the deal would have fallen through? Ha ha, yes. I would just like to state on behalf of the world diaspora of Suarezes that I do not bite people in public and am not a racist.</p> <p>I would now like to remind you, even though you need no reminding, of some of the very many highlights of my moderately competent career so far.</p> <p>You will of course recall my quotidian showings for Manchester City, particularly the time when I came on at 88 minutes for Edin Dzeko in a pre-season friendly. A friendly, I should add, not against any old club, but against probably the biggest soccer team in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Galaxy. I then came on for the chinless wonder Samir Nasri in the 67nd minute of a match against none other than Wolverhampton Wanderers. I think you will agree, this shows that above all I am a footballer.</p> <p>After workaday performances like that it was little wonder that Barcelona came calling, as they were in the market for an average player who can do a number of things reasonably well in the Segunda División. If you don’t speak Spanish this means a league that is even better than La Liga. Unsurprisingly a solid 6/10 player like me is always in demand, and off I went to Sevilla on loan, a move which saw Croatian chancer and second-rate journeyman Ivan Rakitic move to Barcelona as a makeweight for my deal.</p> <p>My Sevilla debut, known as The Day of the Dawn of Denis Suarez or <em>El Día del Amanecer de Denis Suárez</em> was on 12th August 2014 in the world’s most prestigious competition, the UEFA Super Cup. That season is forever known as the <em>annus mediocris mirabilis</em> because it proved that even garden variety water carriers like me can contribute to winning one of European football’s top titles. It was a victory for the little man.</p> <p>After my two goal haul that season, it wasn’t long before the scouts of Villareal came a-calling for some of that old Suarez average magic and sure enough I ended up moving to the second greatest team in the Valencia region, until Barcelona could once again not resist my reasonably proficient charms no longer. And then, the happiest day of many Arsenal fans’ lives, or at least the ones who are connoisseurs of occasionally reliable three star midfielders. I signed on loan for about three months.</p> <p>I enjoyed meeting Mr. Emery again. I asked him what the tactical plan was, and where he saw a fair to middling midfielder like me playing. He said he calls his system ‘El Secadora’, which literally translates to ‘The Tumble Dryer’. I have not heard of this before, but Mr. Emery is often far ahead of current thinking.</p> <p>“I call it The Tumble Dryer, because currently I am like the man who is desperate for a dry shirt and is late for work. He throws the wet shirts into the tumble dryer in a panic and switches it on. Shirts of all colours are thrown together in the tumble dryer. Just chuck them in there and wack the machine onto the highest heat. So Denis, you will play central midfield, or wide left or wide right, centre half, or right back, or perhaps left back,” he said.</p> <p>You have to admire a man who values slightly above average players who can play in several different positions over the more romantic and magical players, naming no names. I am looking forward to showing off my run-of-the-mill skills off at Huddersfield on Saturday and then perhaps at the Borisov Arena in Barysaw, Belarus on Thursday. What a time to be alive for an unremarkable midfielder.</p> <p>I would like to thank Arsenal Gentleman for two things: One for giving up his column inches to me this week and secondly for my Gentleman’s Name, Denis Sudworth, ‘The Middling Midfielder’. Apparently my special move is a 15-yard reasonably accurate pass to a teammate called ‘The Quite Good Pass’.</p> <p>I look forward to showing off my range of quite good passes to you all and will relish the sound of polite applause as my name is read out on the tannoy.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&amp;linkname=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Farsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186%2F&#038;title=Arsenal%20Gentleman%E2%80%99s%20Weekly%20Review" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/arsenal-gentlemans-weekly-review-186/" data-a2a-title="Arsenal Gentleman’s Weekly Review"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>Oh yes, I&#8217;m the Greek defender (ooh ooh)</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/oh-yes-im-the-greek-defender-ooh-ooh/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 06:58:46 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[dinos mavropanos]]></category> <category><![CDATA[laurent koscielny]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Shkodran Mustafi]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28271</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Oh yes, I&#039;m the Greek defender (ooh ooh)" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mavropanos_arsenal-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />Richard III did cast his eye upon the stout yeoman he had available to him as he prepared to go into battle against the hordes from the north.

Our recent record on the road has not been great. We&#8217;ve lost four of our last six and drawn the others –  two points from a possible eighteen is a feeble return, particularly when you look at some of the teams we&#8217;ve faced. It&#8217;s something <a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/emery-my-first-critic-is-myself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Spaniard knows he has to correct</a> tomorrow:</p> <blockquote><p>I think we need to do better away. We started very well away, changing also our mentality to get more points away, but now we need to recover this confidence, to recover this performance and the next opportunity is Saturday against Huddersfield.</p></blockquote> <p>He also knows that his team has an issue defensively, one he sounds a bit unsure about:</p> <blockquote><p>We know that defensively we need to do better &#8230; we’ve tried playing with three centre-backs and two centre-backs. We’ve won with three centre-backs and two centre-backs.</p></blockquote> <p>The main problem he has right now is lack of personnel. Hector Bellerin, our best right back by some distance and someone who is an important part of our attack too, is out for the reason. Rob Holding is out for the season. Sokratis is out until the end of the month, so it&#8217;s not as if he has much in the way of options.</p> <p>However, you wonder if the three fixtures we have coming up against Huddersfield, Southampton and then Bournemouth – along with two games against BATE Borisov in the Europa League – might be the perfect time to give Dinos Mavropanos a run to see what he can do. I think because we&#8217;re all a bit desperate for something &#8230; anything &#8230; to make us better at the back, expectations of a 21 year old with two Arsenal games under his belt are a bit high, but at this point if we want to change something he&#8217;s about the only option we have available to us.</p> <p>Famously, Arsene Wenger said <a href="https://arseblog.news/2017/08/one-night-with-arsene-wenger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there&#8217;s a price to pay</a> when you play young defenders:</p> <blockquote><p>You pay for the education of young players with points. I play a young central defender of 20-years-old and I know he will cost me points in the season. If I play a 28-year-old centre-back, maybe less talented, he will cost me less points, but then I will not be giving a chance to a young player.</p> <p>At some stage, I must say, as a manager sometimes you feel lonely to stand up there and say, ‘No, I want this boy to play because he deserves it&#8217;. I know as well that he will make mistakes, because you learn your job at 23-years of age. 23 to 24 you have a player. Until 23 he will be up and down.</p></blockquote> <p>It strikes me that&#8217;s the situation we&#8217;re in right now with Mavropanos and Mustafi. The young player might make mistakes because he&#8217;s inexperienced and still learning the game, but you have to offset that against the fact you&#8217;ve got the more senior man who has cost you points throughout the season anyway, and always looks as if he&#8217;s got an error or two in him.</p> <p>I guess it&#8217;s something Emery has to weigh up and consider, and I do wonder if the fact that Mavropanos was <a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/mavropanos-to-sit-our-europa-league-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left out of our Europa League squad</a>, sacrificed because we struggled to make the home-grown quotient, is an indication that perhaps he&#8217;s not considered quite ready yet. Nevertheless, if there is a time to give him a chance it&#8217;s a run of fixtures which are, on paper at least, very winnable, and let&#8217;s remember that he&#8217;d likely be played alongside Laurent Koscielny.</p> <p>If you&#8217;re playing a young central defender, the ideal situation is to have an experienced man alongside him who can guide him through games. At 33 the Frenchman is exactly that, and it&#8217;s worth considering that even though he&#8217;s struggling, our right back is likely to be Stephan Lichtsteiner who has plenty of knowledge he can impart to help his young colleague during the 90 minutes. My gut tells me that with points at a premium Emery will, like many managers would in this kind situation, err on the side of caution and stick with Mustafi, but if it were me I&#8217;d be very tempted to give the younger man a go. It&#8217;d be brave, but sometimes that&#8217;s handsomely rewarded.</p> <p>Also, I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that Mavropanos in, Mustafi out is somehow a recipe for instant defensive stability. Our issues go beyond that by some distance, but when you have to try and change something, and your options are this limited, maybe it&#8217;s worth a go. It might well be the chance he needs, and if it doesn&#8217;t work out or he&#8217;s not quite ready yet, then it provides greater clarity about what we need to do in the summer when we face the arduous task of rebuilding a squad which is going to undergo a serious shake-up. Let&#8217;s see what happens, but I think my tolerance for a young player making an error would be far greater than seeing Mustafi slip or slide because the forward has blinked at him while running towards our box.</p> <p>That topic is something I discuss with Clive Palmer on today&#8217;s Arsecast, along with lots of other stuff, so you can check it out and listen/subscribe below.

The player’s profile is not significant enough to cause an Özil or Sanchez type frisson in the Gunners fan base, but as a Barcelona player, he hardly represents a mystical unknown. Coverage of Barcelona is plentiful enough for a fair portion of the fan base to be familiar with the player, his strengths and his shortcomings.</p> <p>Even if you are not a seasoned La Liga observer, the proliferation of data at our fingertips means we can get an artist’s impression of a player before he has had a chance to don his shinpads. Reporting on transfers is so fastidious that everybody knows a player is joining long before the zany social media announcement video is pieced together.</p> <p>That goes some way to quelling any sense of excitement and it also gives us plenty of time to fill the gaps with YouTube videos, Statsbomb radars and expert opinion from those that have followed his career closely. I observed much the same process when Arsenal signed Bernd Leno and Sokratis Papastathopoulos this summer, enough people have a good working knowledge of the Bundesliga to <a href="https://arseblog.com/2018/07/sokratis-papastathopoulos-what-will-the-new-man-bring-to-arsenal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">familiarise us with a player before they make their debut</a>.</p> <p><iframe width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be6p6yJPDes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>The overall feeling of <em>whelmedness</em> over the Suarez signing was also informed by the austere context the club is operating in. Confirmation that Arsenal weren’t planning to spend cash money during this window created confusion and a little resentment. There is also a sense that Arsenal would have been better off investing in a defender, though I am not sure I concur in that respect.</p> <p>Arsenal’s defence needs a flamethrower taking to it, don’t get me wrong. But I’m not convinced the transformational signing required to rebuild Arsenal’s rickety old rope bridge backline was out there in January. The club needs studied, long term solutions in defence- not least with Koscielny and Lichtsteiner out of contract this summer.</p> <p>Suarez seems to be a short term signing. The fact that Arsenal did not want an obligation to buy clause inserted into the transfer- to the extent that they were prepared to walk away from the deal altogether- is not a resounding affirmation of faith. You would think a loan with an obligation to buy would be a pretty sweet deal for a club with newly released funds available in the summer. Buy now, pay later is the perfect deal for a club in that scenario and Arsenal still weren’t interested.</p> <p>On the upside, the player himself resuscitated the deal by agreeing to sign a new contract with Barcelona in order to protect his value. That suggests Suarez is hungry to play and keen to put himself in the shop window, for Arsenal or A.Nother. The phrase ‘value protection’ pretty much sums up his Barcelona career.</p> <p>Barca bought him back to the club due to a dirt cheap buyback option they reserved upon selling him to Villarreal in 2015. This is a common part of Barcelona’s strategy, the loan system is different to England, so instead of farming young fringe players out on loan, the bigger Spanish clubs tend to sell with a low buyback clause.</p> <p>Barca did not re-sign Suarez in 2016 because they thought he was the heir apparent to Lionel Messi, but because at €3.5m he represented excellent value for a squad player with a healthy sell-on fee likely in a few seasons’ time. This sort of practice will become commonplace in the Premier League soon enough when the number of loans permitted are capped in time for the 2020-21 season.</p> <p>I am not one of those seasoned La Liga watchers, but I have absorbed enough secondary expert analysis to consider myself an absolute authority on Denis Suarez. We are told, and the data suggests, that he is more of a link player- or ‘final third entry player’- than he is a goal or assist machine. This has caused a little anxiety from those of us that have watched Arsenal struggle to create for significant periods recently.</p> <p>But one thing we have learned about Unai Emery is that this is exactly the sort of player that he values. Aaron Ramsey has been reduced to the status of high level squad player and Mesut Özil hasn’t so much been frozen out as frozen out, thawed out and refrozen again. Whereas the likes of Alex Iwobi, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Danny Welbeck (pre-injury) and Matteo Guendouzi have earned the manager’s trust on a regular basis.</p> <p>Emery likes to shuffle his pack in terms of personnel and formations, so he prefers generalists to specialists. Mesut Özil and Aaron Ramsey have signature moves, but Emery doesn’t value his tin openers as much as he values his Swiss army knives. Arsenal have recently taken to playing two strikers, which has probably cost them a little technical control. In short, another ‘final third entry’ player is quite valuable to the team at the moment.</p> <p>Arsenal have stacks of firepower in Lacazette and Aubameyang, the problem is getting the ball to them in an orderly fashion, something the team has really struggled to do in Mkhitaryan’s absence. <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/what-we-can-expect-denis-suarez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In his piece on Arsenal.com</a>, Edward Stratmann describes Suarez as “<em>a nifty dribbler, who&#8217;s very comfortable on the ball and uses swift changes of pace and direction effectively in 1v1 duels</em>.” To say Arsenal lack dribblers is a little bit like saying Jose Mourinho lacks humility.</p> <p>Opponents have cottoned onto Arsenal’s passing out from the back. They either stand back and let the defenders have possession, or else mark the centre halves and force Leno to kick long. Teams generally know that Arsenal want to work their full-backs into positions to cut the ball back from the by-line and without Bellerin, the Gunners have lost one of their prolific avenues for doing so. They need another way of progressing the ball through the thirds.</p> <p>In recent seasons, they have lost Cazorla, Chamberlain, Rosicky, Sanchez and Wilshere- all of whom are dribblers to some extent or other. Santi, Rosicky and Wilshere always had fairly modest goal and assists totals during their Arsenal careers, but at their best, they were undoubtedly a valuable creative force and I think Emery will hope for a similar impact from Suarez. Whether he manages that will go a long way to determining whether Arsenal fans are overwhelmed or underwhelmed by his impact come May.</p> <p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/Stillberto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Stillberto</a>&#8211; Or like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stillberto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&amp;linkname=Over%20Under" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Fover-under-denis-suarez%2F&#038;title=Over%20Under" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/over-under-denis-suarez/" data-a2a-title="Over Under"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> <item> <title>Top four finish crucial as Arsenal face another summer of transition</title> <link>https://arseblog.com/2019/02/top-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 07:44:44 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[arseblog]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Arseblog, the arsenal blog]]></category> <category><![CDATA[aaron ramsey]]></category> <category><![CDATA[arsenal transfer business]]></category> <category><![CDATA[danny welbeck]]></category> <category><![CDATA[mesut ozil]]></category> <category><![CDATA[petr cech]]></category> <guid isPermaLink="false">https://arseblog.com/?p=28265</guid> <description><![CDATA[<img width="1500" height="800" src="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018.jpg 1500w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-300x160.jpg 300w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-768x410.jpg 768w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-696x371.jpg 696w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-1068x570.jpg 1068w, https://arseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ozil_2018-788x420.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" />So Manchester City are back on top of the Premier League.

I know this really doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with us because we&#8217;re not even close to that, but it&#8217;s an illustration of how quickly things can change – and not for the first time either this season.</p> <p>A few months back everyone was talking City were unstoppable, the team to beat, the runaway champions running away with it again. Then they hit a blip, Liverpool blasted beyond them and, if I&#8217;m right, had a chance to open the gap to 10 points about a month ago when they visited the Etihad. Instead, they lost 2-1, City put the pressure back on and now they&#8217;re top again.</p> <p>It shows that teams don&#8217;t even need to lose games to lose ground. Liverpool&#8217;s last two fixtures have ended in draws, but that&#8217;s a four point swing as City won their last two – and let&#8217;s remember they lost to Newcastle just last week. All of which is to point out that as we head into the final 13 games of the season (lucky for some), a situation which might look difficult can turn around quite quickly if a few results don&#8217;t go the right way for our top four rivals. Even so, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much margin for error.</p> <p>I think we&#8217;re going to need something in the region of 30 points from these fixtures to do it, which sounds pretty daunting – even if we are just 3 points off fourth right now. Last year 4th place = 75 points, the years before it was 76, 66, and 70, and in 2013-14 we finished in fourth place with 79 points – one point more than we won the league with in 1997-98!</p> <p>That&#8217;s evidence of just how competitive that fight for Champions League places has become, and in order to get there Unai Emery is going to have to produce a run not dissimilar from the one the team went on after the first two games of the season, knowing all the while that draws may not be defeats but they can still be quite damaging.</p> <p><a href="https://arseblog.news/2019/02/torreira-were-focused-on-a-top-four-finish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Torreira is gunning for it though</a>, urging his teammates to really knuckle down to achieve this season&#8217;s main goal:</p> <blockquote><p>The squad is focused on qualifying for the Champions League because a big club like Arsenal deserves to be in that competition. It’s about fighting with everything we’ve got to achieve our objective because that would be massive.</p></blockquote> <p>I know we used to laugh/scoff/roll our eyes [delete where appropriate] at the suggestion that top four is a trophy, but if we do it this season I&#8217;m going to crowdfund enough money to buy a tin mine and in the deep forges below the earth we&#8217;ll make it reality and the team can parade it around the pitch on the final day. Does that say a lot about where we are right now? Yes, it does, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t our reality.</p> <p>When you consider the work that this squad needs in the summer, doing it with a Champions League budget would make it a fair bit easier. Leaving aside the fact we&#8217;ve lost our Head of Recruitment and haven&#8217;t yet replaced him or appointed a Technical Director or Head Scout, we can all see that there are areas of the team DEFENCE that really DEFENCE need to be DEFENCE improved consiDEFENCEerably.</p> <p>Add to that the inevitable departures, something Andrew Allen and I discussed on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/andrew-andrew-7-24510595" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last night&#8217;s Patreon live stream</a>, and you&#8217;ll start to realise just how much work there is to do this summer. We listed the players who are going and those who could, and when you lay it all out, it&#8217;s quite considerable:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Petr Cech</strong> &#8211; retiring</li> <li><strong>Aaron Ramsey</strong> &#8211; leaving for free</li> <li><strong>Danny Welbeck</strong> &#8211; leaving for free</li> <li><strong>Mohamed Elneny</strong> &#8211; barely plays, surely a candidate for sale</li> <li><strong>Shkodran Mustafi</strong> &#8211; already on the transfer list according to some reports</li> <li><strong>Stephan Lichtsteiner</strong> &#8211; contract expires, shouldn&#8217;t be renewed</li> <li><strong>Mesut Ozil</strong> &#8211; his future has to be in serious doubt</li> </ul> <p>Already that&#8217;s seven members of the first team squad, then add to that the fact Laurent Koscielny is 33 and Nacho Monreal will be 33 later this month. They are just naturally heading towards the final stages of their careers and will need to replaced sooner rather than later, so as much as we want to look at this summer as one of consolidation it&#8217;s going to be far more transitional than we might like.</p> <p>The idea of having to do all that with the limited budget we appear to have is tough enough, but doing it while spending another season in the Europa League is potentially quite scary. It&#8217;s why I hope there&#8217;s a coherent strategy when it comes to our scouting and recruitment, because I don&#8217;t think we can continue to make the kind of stop-gap signings we have in the past. If it&#8217;s another project youth or Project Multiple Guendouzis, at least it&#8217;s a plan.</p> <p>The reality is that as long as we remain &#8216;self-sustaining&#8217; we will not be able to compete with the likes of Man City, Man Utd and Chelsea for transfers. Does it mean we can&#8217;t create a competitive team? Of course we can, but we need to be seriously smart with how we buy players, sell players, and manage the ones we have. It&#8217;s also why we can&#8217;t afford to keep missing out on the tens of millions of pounds that being outside the Champions League costs us, and the longer you&#8217;re out of it the more difficult it is to get back in.</p> <p>We can afford few slip-ups between now and the end of the season, and without resorting to cliches, we&#8217;re in &#8216;every game is a cup final&#8217; territory now. We&#8217;ve won a few of those in our time, so let&#8217;s hope that bodes well for this challenging run-in.</p> <p>Righto, that&#8217;s it from me this morning. We&#8217;ll start to look ahead to Huddersfield at the weekend in the next couple of days. Back tomorrow with an Arsecast and all the rest.</p> <p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="Google+" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_reddit" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="Reddit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_linkedin" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&amp;linkname=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" title="LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_dd addtoany_share_save addtoany_share" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Farseblog.com%2F2019%2F02%2Ftop-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition%2F&#038;title=Top%20four%20finish%20crucial%20as%20Arsenal%20face%20another%20summer%20of%20transition" data-a2a-url="https://arseblog.com/2019/02/top-four-finish-crucial-as-arsenal-face-another-summer-of-transition/" data-a2a-title="Top four finish crucial as Arsenal face another summer of transition"></a></p>]]></content:encoded> </item> </channel> </rss>
