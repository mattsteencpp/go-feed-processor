The most powerful snowflake in America was triggered by Alec Baldwin. “Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC!” Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097116612279316480"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lest there be any doubt about the implications, Trump tweeted in December of 2018 that “A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC &amp;amp; Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live,” declaring, “It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, can’t be legal? Only defame &amp;amp; belittle! Collusion?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s SNL tweets are of a piece with a larger, disturbing pattern of behavior in which he violates his oath to protect and defend the Constitution by calling for First Amendment freedoms to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/trump-wants-to-censor-the-press/542142/?utm_source=feed"&gt;be abridged&lt;/a&gt; by bureaucrats and legislators; and by &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/trump-press-crackdown/542670/?utm_source=feed"&gt;calling the press&lt;/a&gt; a public enemy and a target of his “drain the swamp” agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he has stated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-escalates-threats-against-press-calls-news-coverage-frankly-disgusting/2017/10/11/32996dba-ae9c-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html"&gt;It’s frankly disgusting&lt;/a&gt; the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write and people should want to look into it.”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Network news has become &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918267396493922304"&gt;so partisan, distorted and fake&lt;/a&gt; that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918112884630093825"&gt;With all of the Fake News&lt;/a&gt; coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“Why Isn’t the Senate Intel Committee &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/915894251967385600"&gt;looking into&lt;/a&gt; the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/889435104841523201"&gt;Drain the Swamp&lt;/a&gt; should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it’s actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“With all of its phony unnamed sources &amp;amp; highly slanted &amp;amp; even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/886544734788997125"&gt;DISTORTING DEMOCRACY&lt;/a&gt; in our country!”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;“The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more) is not my enemy, it is the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065"&gt;enemy of the American people&lt;/a&gt;. SICK!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These authoritarian outbursts would justify &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/impeach-donald-trump-article-one/542841/?utm_source=feed"&gt;an article of impeachment&lt;/a&gt;.

Syringes and intravenous lines, maybe. An X-ray or CT scan slammed theatrically into a light box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any medical scene is incomplete without an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine running in the background, its jagged line tracing across the screen reassuringly, or alarming to cue a dramatic threat. The EKG is the backbeat of many hospital scenes on television. &lt;em&gt;Important medical things are happening here&lt;/em&gt;, it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tap into that potent association, many private medical practices, urgent care clinics, community hospitals, technology companies, and health-care product designers use EKG imagery in their advertising. Most of those images bear little resemblance to actual EKG tracings. The spikes and bumps generated for signs or emblems (like &lt;a href="https://www.thedoctorstv.com/"&gt;the logo&lt;/a&gt; of the daytime talk show &lt;em&gt;The Doctors&lt;/em&gt;, for example) mostly amount to arbitrary peaks and valleys. They do not reflect the output of a human heart, healthy or diseased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/the-new-apple-watchs-heart-monitoring-is-complicated/570115/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Should your watch monitor your heart?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But accuracy might be less important than allegory. Like the white coat or the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus"&gt;caduceus&lt;/a&gt;, the EKG has become talismanic, more valuable for the symbolism it provides than any diagnostic information it can convey. Now that EKGs are making their way into smartwatches, their symbolic purpose could risk overtaking their medical one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable medical technology promises a new, and better, way to manage personal health. Whether it’s Fitbits counting steps and calories burned, continuous blood glucose monitors aiding insulin dosing for diabetic patients, or Bluetooth earpieces offering round-the-clock heart rate and body temperature tracking, wearable devices sell the promise of the coldly clinical made portably intimate. Continuous EKG monitoring, like that available in the latest Apple Watch, might seem like a small technological leap, putting what was once the sole purview of hospitals and doctor’s offices neatly around a consumer’s wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But continuous EKG monitoring is a little different from other, more discrete medical information. Unlike devices that measure more cleanly numerical metrics—step counts or target heart rates or blood glucose levels—a wearable EKG display doesn’t give the user an easy sense of hitting targets or falling short. Reading an EKG tracing is nuanced and interpretive, more art than math. A Fitbit gives you a number. An EKG paints a picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12-lead EKG, the gold standard of the diagnostic, measures the flow of current from 12 points on the patient’s body, offering a 360-degree view of the heart’s electrical activity. Its tracing reports the patient’s heart rate, rhythm, and regularity. Because the various parts of the heart produce different shapes of electrical activity owing to their size and muscularity, the EKG can also detect which chambers are beating at what time, and whether these chambers are correctly synced up and beating effectively. The larger a muscle is, the stronger its electrical impulses, so the size of an EKG wave can also indicate if parts of the heart muscle are enlarged or dangerously thickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most urgent diagnostic use of the device determines the presence and location of cardiac damage due to decreased blood flow. Areas of the heart getting less oxygen will show changes in their electrical conduction, and the 12-lead EKG provides real-time information: not just indicating whether a patient is having a heart attack, but also which coronary vessels are most likely blocked. The 12-lead EKG can also detect the location of scarring left behind by prior, sometimes silent heart attacks. An EKG tracing will clearly show an area of dead heart muscle no longer conducting electrical signals. &lt;em&gt;Dead meat don’t beat&lt;/em&gt;, as cardiologists put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s plenty that a snapshot EKG can’t do, including diagnosing intermittent problems with rhythm or changes that only occur with certain activities. An EKG doesn’t capture the shape or function of the heart’s valves, nor can it diagnose precarious plaques in the coronary arteries that could signal heart attacks waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fewer number of leads an EKG has, the less information it can give you. A one-lead EKG, such as the kind that appears in the latest iteration of the Apple Watch, gives just a single vantage point. For the diagnosis of some cardiac abnormalities, that may be akin to only solving one side of a Rubik’s Cube. A watch endowed with this kind of EKG feature likely won’t have a large public-health impact, despite &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/health/"&gt;promotional materials&lt;/a&gt; from Apple touting the “momentous achievement” of a wearable “that can provide critical data for doctors and peace of mind for you.” Apple’s not alone, either. Another smartwatch-EKG offering, &lt;a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/move-ecg"&gt;from Withings&lt;/a&gt;, promises “the opportunity to take an ECG anytime and anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Withings was unable to be reached for comment, but Apple pointed to a statement from its vice president of health, Dr. Sumbul Desai. Desai &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/12/ecg-app-and-irregular-heart-rhythm-notification-available-today-on-apple-watch/"&gt;contends&lt;/a&gt; that features like the EKG “help users have more informed conversations with their physicians.” But evidence &lt;a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2695678"&gt;does not suggest&lt;/a&gt; that taking EKGs for asymptomatic individuals is beneficial. The average wearable user might be even less likely to benefit. A few years ago, the &lt;a href="https://iphone-tricks.com/news/4207-this-is-the-average-apple-watch-user-study"&gt;typical&lt;/a&gt; Apple Watch owner was a 40-year-old male. That might change over time, but even so, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm"&gt;maintains&lt;/a&gt; that only two percent of patients under 65 suffer from atrial fibrillation, the only arrhythmia that the Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850660/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-2018"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/04/the-incredible-success-of-a-heart-monitor-made-for-the-iphone/255323/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The incredible success of a heart monitor made for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bluster, these devices aren’t entirely new. “Personal” EKGs have been available for years in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.alivecor.com/"&gt;thumb-drive-sized, portable monitors&lt;/a&gt; whose fingertip sensors can pull a one-lead EKG tracing and sync the recording to a tablet or smartphone. That’s less convenient than a smartwatch, to be sure, but diagnostic utility might not be the most important outcome. By incorporating an EKG into smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/move-ecg"&gt;and their marketing&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and other electronics makers use EKG to brand their watches, in the way that health-care providers use them to establish trust in their clinics, or television shows deploy them to communicate medical professionalism. Even when rendered nonsensically or in bulk, like the sloppy, narrow-range raw data a watch or portable monitor may generate, an EKG feels weighty and complex, standing in for doctors and their expected acumen. &lt;em&gt;Don’t worry&lt;/em&gt;, the purveyors of an EKG are communicating, &lt;em&gt;we’ve got this. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of the EKG has always pitted cutting-edge medical advances against the placebo of quasi-medical reassurance. The first electrocardiograph was developed in 1901 by Dr. Wilhelm Einthoven, a Dutch cardiologist. Einthoven’s original “string galvanometer,” which weighed approximately 600 pounds, required five skilled operators and a ready supply of water to cool its massive electromagnets. The machine was virtually impossible to use and its readouts equally difficult to interpret, yet it became a near-immediate sensation in the medical world, and Einthoven won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern 12-lead EKG is more streamlined, and the future (if the current crop of wearables is any indication) promises further downsizing of the device, with even more potential for unobtrusive integration into daily life. But whether it be room- or wrist-sized, the EKG has always attempted to record the size, shape, and timing of the heart’s intrinsic electrical impulses, giving people the ability to review, track, and potentially intervene on its functions. Put differently, the EKG tries to reframe the heart as a machine that can be monitored and, to some extent, mastered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/medical-technology-makes-time-of-death-harder-to-pinpoint/386968/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Medical technology makes “time of death” harder to pinpoint&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrinking and wearing an EKG  is a symptom of technology’s drive to subsume health and wellness, and it renews a belief in humanity’s mastery of the heart, that most important muscle. EKGs might start to seem capable of producing meaning on their own, instead of producing pictures that can be interpreted by medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That aligns the continuous, single-lead, wearable EKG with the set designer’s intentions for the symbol. The EKG—especially the 12-lead device—offers real diagnostics, but not nearly as often as its traces convey the symbology of health. As it shrinks, that secondary meaning could become more primary. The wearable EKG offers the comforting weight of medicine itself, worn on the wrist like an amulet warding off evil, whether it ever gets used or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/AUKBFwcWwQU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew Bomback</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/andrew-bomback/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Michelle Au</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/michelle-au/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTS1ZH7U/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Ralph Orlowski / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Smartwatches Are Changing the Purpose of the EKG</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/AUKBFwcWwQU/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-17T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T11:37:33-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-573385</id><summary type="html">Wearables help cast the medical test as a talisman of health-care competence. &lt;a href="http://www.objectsobjectsobjects.com"&gt;An Object Lesson&lt;/a&gt;.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/the-apple-watch-ekgs-hidden-purpose/573385/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Chloe Aridjis is not a novelist who appears to care about plot, so let’s get the story of &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, her third book, out of the way. Its protagonist, a moody, Morrissey-loving teenager named Luisa, meets a boy named Tomás and lets him persuade her to run away from home. The two take the bus from Mexico City to Oaxaca, where they camp in a beach town called Zipolite and where Luisa rapidly loses interest in Tomás, replacing him with a silent, mysterious-seeming figure. After a while, her father tracks her down, and she returns to Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These events are less plot, in truth, than scaffolding.&lt;em&gt; Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt; derives little energy from what happens to Luisa, or from how she changes during her travels. Instead, it works like a poem, gathering steam through image, repetition, and metaphor. Aridjis deploys set pieces the way a poet might, and seems particularly attracted to performances: peacocking Goths in a nightclub, a man building an elaborate sandcastle,&lt;em&gt; lucha libre&lt;/em&gt; fighters soaring through their choreographed moves. She riffs like a poet, too, letting each image twist and grow into the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These tendencies aren’t surprising, given Aridjis’s background. Her father, Homero Aridjis, is among Mexico’s most celebrated poets, and the surrealist writer and painter Leonora Carrington was a family friend. Aridjis curated Carrington’s retrospective at Tate Liverpool in 2015 and writes art criticism in addition to fiction. Her art writing leaks into &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, though not as forcefully as it may have into her graduate dissertation, which compared the autobiographies of 19th-century French magicians to the symbolist poets who were their contemporaries. In &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, both of those influences are equally clear. Like a magician, Aridjis is obsessed with elusiveness; like a symbolist, she far prefers imagination and metaphor to plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Aridjis alerts readers to this preference early and often. &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt; begins with Luisa on the beach at Zipolite, contemplating the ancient Greeks, to whom she returns often. She muses that they “created stories out of a simple juxtaposition of natural features … investing rocks and caves with meaning.” Aridjis does this, too. Nature comes alive in her hands. She reserves her fullest imagistic powers for the water: Early in the novel, Luisa watches the surf “write and erase its long ribbon of foam,” and later, in an image I have found impossible to shake from my mind, the waves become “rows of muscular men with interlocking arms that came closer in with each roll.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Aridjis tends to wear her influences lightly, but she makes an exception for Baudelaire. Before Luisa runs away from home, her French teacher assigns Baudelaire’s &lt;em&gt;Les fleurs du mal&lt;/em&gt;. Luisa latches on to “Un voyage à Cythère,” a bleak poem in which Aphrodite’s native island transforms into the deserted site of a hanging. At first, Luisa, wanting an airtight explanation, tries to explain the poem: “The poem’s heart was a carbonized black, and Kythera a somber rocky place where dreams got dashed against its shores.” But her teacher steers her away from that reading: Better, he suggests, to focus on what lies beneath the text. Or as he puts it, better to remember that “events were the mere froth of things, and one’s true interest should be the sea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If there is a moment when Aridjis herself appears in &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, this is it. From this scene on, she adheres fully to the symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé’s dictum that literature should “evoke little by little an object in order to show a state of soul, or inversely, to choose an object and release from it a state of soul through a series of unravelings … There must always be enigma in poetry, and the goal of literature—there is no other—is to evoke objects.” In &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, Aridjis translates this idea effectively from poetry to fiction. As Luisa roams Zipolite, Aridjis invests her full literary powers in sketching the beach around her. She rarely writes about Luisa’s emotions explicitly, but her descriptions slowly guide readers into Luisa’s “state of soul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Perhaps the most important descriptions in &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt; are of seashells. When Luisa arrives in Zipolite, she learns that its name might be Zapotec for “‘Lugar de Caracoles,’ place of seashells, an attractive thought since spirals are such neat arrangements of space and time.” Later, she recalls a party in Mexico City with “a large spiral of white powder … [its] whorls so thick it looked like the ghost of an ammonite.” At that party, Luisa achieved a state of happy suspension in time, a state she struggles to summon in Zipolite. As she roams the beach town, hunting for shells and examining crushed toads on the sidewalk, it’s clear that she’s not content. But by only letting Luisa express her unhappiness obliquely, Aridjis evokes dual longings: Maybe Luisa wants time to pass more quickly, or maybe she wishes to no longer care whether time is passing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This duality of meaning squares well with Mallarmé’s disdain for single interpretations. In an 1891 interview with the journalist Jules Huret, the poet claimed that writers who “take the object in its entirety and show it, lack mystery; they take away from readers the delicious joy that arises when they believe that their own minds are creating.” Luisa seems to pursue that same joy, but the narratives she creates are personal. Twice in &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, she falls briefly in love with a man, or rather, the idea of a man. First, there’s Tomás, with whom she travels to Zipolite, but once there, he bores her. Then there’s a man she spots at a beachfront bar, “a ring of silence around him,” who she imagines is a merman. When Luisa discovers that he’s a local boat operator named Gustavo, her interest again fizzles out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This, then, is &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;’ true arc. A moody, Morrissey-loving teenager named Luisa sees magic everywhere. Repeatedly, the magic dissipates, but she doesn’t mind. Here, we can see the 19th-century magicians’ influence in two ways. A magic trick is meant to elude its viewer, and it isn’t meant to last. One trick should give way to the next, and, later, to a vague but lingering memory of amazement. Luisa views her trip the same way. On her return to Mexico City, she has no regrets, no real desire to talk about her time in Zipolite. She’s happy to let it float away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a result, the novel’s satisfactions come not from character growth or plot resolution, but from the evoking of emotion through symbols. As Luisa wanders through Zipolite, she returns to a handful of images: iguanas, breaking waves, shipwrecks, the island of Kythera, an ancient Greek predictive device known as the Antikythera Mechanism. Each one shifts in meaning, like the seashells, and tracking their evolving significance pulls readers deep into the novel’s interpretive project. Few novels operate this way, but many poems do. I found that&lt;em&gt; Sea Monsters &lt;/em&gt;frequently conjured Elizabeth Bishop’s “&lt;a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/fish-2"&gt;The Fish&lt;/a&gt;,” with its rapt attention to the fish’s real and imagined body. The victory at the poem’s end comes not from catching or keeping the fish, but from having beheld it. Observation and beauty create meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The same holds true for &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt;. Often I wished to watch it, or examine it like a canvas. &lt;em&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/em&gt; would lend itself beautifully to movie adaptation, and yet on film, Aridjis’s gifts of evocation would be lost. A shot of waves could not bring the same pleasure as those “rows of muscular men with interlocking arms.” Hearing the word &lt;em&gt;Kythera &lt;/em&gt;is no match for Luisa debating whether she prefers “the cackle of Kythera or the sorceress &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; of Cythère.” The novel’s strength lies in its ability to turn to the next magic trick, the next detail, the next sight. Those sights are all the more impressive when conjured solely from language. By opting out of fiction’s conventional prioritization of plot or character development, Aridjis foregrounds her ability to develop images and metaphors. The result is seductive in its multiplicity.

But nontechnically speaking, the NFL lost. Massively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of the settlement, announced on Friday, were not disclosed. But it doesn’t matter how much money Kaepernick ultimately receives from the NFL; what matters is that he bested a league that has a long history of pummeling its opposition in court, especially players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, the NFL had no other choice. Last August, arbitrator Stephen Burbank rejected the NFL’s request to have the case dismissed. That meant he believed Kaepernick’s team had compiled enough receipts to present their case. With another hearing reportedly scheduled for next month, did the NFL really want to let Kaepernick’s legal team expose those receipts in court?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owners and coaches had already given depositions in Kaepernick’s case, and the details that emerged from those proceedings did not look good for the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/why-the-nfl-is-protesting/540927/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: They took a knee&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the depositions showed just how much league owners were petrified of President Donald Trump, who had loudly criticized the player protests. According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Jerry Jones, who owns the Dallas Cowboys, testified in a deposition that the president had told him in a phone conversation, “This is a very winning, strong issue for me,” and “Tell everybody you can’t win this one. This one lifts me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump felt that public sentiment was on his side when it came to the player protests, and was warning that he would not back off. That conversation with Jones, and separate ones with the Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and the New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, suggested that the league was allowing their fear of Trump to influence how it dealt with Kaepernick and the other protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Kaepernick’s case gone further, there was no question that more sensitive and damaging information would have come out. Who knows what was said about Kaepernick or other players in texts and emails. Even if Kaepernick had lost the case, the NFL would have been left with a significant mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are already criticizing Kaepernick for settling, not realizing how rare it is to see the NFL backed into a corner, especially by a player. Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback ever, couldn’t beat the NFL in court. Even he eventually had to accept his four-game suspension for Deflategate in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/trump-turned-kaepernicks-protest-into-a-success/540999/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How Trump turned Kaepernick’s protest into a success&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Kaepernick was the one to make the NFL eat crow is a special kind of karma. This is just punishment because the league incompetently handled the player protests, starting with Kaepernick’s, from the beginning. Had the league not been so heavy-handed in policing the protests, this issue likely would have abated sooner. Had the league ignored Trump instead of cowering to his bullying, appeasing Trump wouldn’t have become a priority. Had one league owner had the guts to sign Kaepernick, this collusion case would have been a nonstarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But too often the NFL has shown an embarrassing commitment to being on the wrong side of history for the sake of profits. The league settled a $1 billion class-action concussion lawsuit brought by former players, but in the process, the NFL wasted a lot of time looking absolutely foolish denying its culpability. And regardless of the money it spent trying to make the issue go away, concussions and head trauma still haven’t disappeared from the public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still doubt that Kaepernick will ever play in the NFL again, but the point of suing the NFL wasn’t necessarily about resuming his football career. It was about holding the league accountable for something that was entirely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this legal battle with Kaepernick has been resolved, he isn’t going away either. The league will forever have to live with the fact that it was complicit in destroying someone’s career simply because he wished to bring attention to the injustices suffered by his people. If owners and Roger Goodell believe that they no longer will have to face questions about why Kaepernick isn’t in the league, they’re wrong. No matter what an arbitrator rules, how the NFL treated Kaepernick will always be the mistake they can never amend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/OcF-UbJrKVE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Jemele Hill</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/jemele-hill/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX5UQPR/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Loren Elliott / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Kaepernick Won.

Despite progress in overcoming the sin of racism in recent years, racism still exists in American society—causing pain and hurt, and even leading to death. As a case in point, Keith Tharpe sits on death row in Jackson, Georgia, convicted of a gruesome murder 28 years ago. While we cannot speak to the legal issues of this case, it is apparent that racism may have played a part in Tharpe’s death sentence. After the trial, one of the jurors displayed shocking racial prejudice in an affidavit, liberally using racial slurs as he “wondered if black people even have souls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower courts have been unwilling to reconsider the verdict, but the case is &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/DocketFiles/html/Public/18-6819.html"&gt;now before&lt;/a&gt; the United States Supreme Court, which could grant a writ of certiorari to consider the merits of Tharpe’s contention of racial bias. The failure to thoroughly consider the effect of racism in jury deliberations could lead to Tharpe’s execution. We therefore join with many others in asking the Supreme Court to consider this case and the effects of an admittedly racist juror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress against racism in society cannot obscure the fundamental problems with our system of justice if racism infests the application of criminal laws. The Catholic bishops of the United States recently issued a pastoral letter against racism titled “&lt;a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/racism/upload/open-wide-our-hearts.pdf"&gt;Open Wide Our Hearts—The Enduring Call to Love&lt;/a&gt;,” which acknowledged the history of racism in the United States and reaffirmed our commitment to its eradication. We believe that part of our work as religious leaders is to challenge racism by reminding the public that we are all brothers and sisters, equally made in the image of God. As we noted in our letter, racism is a failure to acknowledge the human dignity of all people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever personal prejudices surface in a trial, society relies on appellate courts and especially the Supreme Court to rectify these biases. We thus exhort the Supreme Court to take up Tharpe’s case and correct the clear, documented racism in the case by granting him a new sentencing hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bishops, we take very seriously Jesus’s call to visit those in prison. We have visited prisoners, including those on death row. In most parishes with prisons or jails, a priest or deacon visits every week to offer religious services. We have been blessed to witness true rehabilitation and meet prisoners who earnestly seek redemption through God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the stain of racism that leads us to oppose Tharpe’s execution. The Catholic Church teaches that in the light of the Gospel, “the death penalty is inadmissible,” a teaching that has been reinforced most recently by Pope Francis. Indeed, the death penalty violates human dignity even if the convicted individual has committed a terrible crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus called his followers to console those who mourn. While seeking consideration and mercy for Tharpe, we also pray for the family of Jacquelyn Freeman, who died at Tharpe’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our pastoral letter, we explain that racism comes in many forms—and one of them is the sin of omission. This occurs when individuals, communities, and even churches remain silent and fail to act against racial injustice when it is encountered. To do justice requires an honest acknowledgment of our failures and the restoring of right relationships among us. That’s why we are speaking out about Tharpe’s case. The U.S. Supreme Court must intervene in his case to ensure that fairness is protected and justice is defended—before it’s too late. To do nothing would be tragic not only for Tharpe, but for our collective dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/xT6TEv751vw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Wilton D.

She had appeared in a video for Take Back the Night, the organization known for fighting dating violence, sexual violence, and domestic violence on college campuses nationally. Her mother said, “Her heart was kind; her spirit generous; her soul wise. She gave her smile to everyone who needed it; to everyone who hadn’t even realized they did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are just a few of the nearly 2,500 women listed in Wilcox’s album during the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where is the outrage? Where are the marches, the speeches? I know where the silence is. It is everywhere, and it is deafening,” Wilcox says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her crusade, she says, was spurred in part by the media frenzy about the shooting death of a gorilla, Harambe, at the Cincinnati Zoo and the uproar over the killing of Cecil the lion, shot by a Minnesota dentist as a trophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an animal lover, she was horrified by those killings. But as she saw the social-media fury and the online petitions spread, she asked herself: W&lt;em&gt;hat about women?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are people and they deserve to have their lives valued,” she posted on Facebook in 2016, after Harambe’s death. “They deserve our voices speaking out on their behalf. And when they are abused, assaulted, murdered and erased they deserve our attention and our outrage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI releases crime data every year, including the number of women who have been killed by men, but local police are not required to file reports to the federal agency, so some state figures are missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida, for example, has not provided its data to the FBI since 1996, according to reports by the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit organization that advocates to stop gun violence. Numbers from Alabama and Illinois have also been unavailable or limited in certain years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1996, 1,613 to 2,129 women have been murdered by men each year in the United States, FBI data show. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, the FBI counted 1,733 women. An overwhelming majority of those women were killed by a man they knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you just go by the raw numbers, it is undoubtedly an undercount of domestic-violence homicides,” says April Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University and an expert on domestic-violence homicides and gun laws. Still, she adds, “it’s the most accurate picture we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilcox, however, is doing something the FBI does not: putting faces to the cases. Recording the correct number of women murdered isn’t her only goal. Her work is about searching for their stories, finding their photos, trying to learn who they were, so that these women aren’t forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilcox is no stranger to violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she was 21, she began dating a man she met in a bar in Dallas. She’ll never forget the first time he hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a night out at a dance club, Wilcox’s boyfriend stepped into the restroom. When he came back, she said, he sprayed cologne into her face, which burned her eyes as she groped her way to the bathroom to rinse it out. It was an accident, she says he told her. But Wilcox knew it was an attempt to humiliate her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violence escalated, Wilcox said, culminating in a night that left a deep scar on the inside of her arm and a memory of abuse that echoes the stories of the lost women for whom she searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was hot and the power had gone out, leaving her with no air-conditioning as she read a book by candlelight in her apartment. Her boyfriend began kissing her leg, she said, but soon she felt his teeth digging into her as he bit her. She told him to stop, but he put his hand at the base of her throat, pushed her down on the bed, and, after telling her he wanted to taste her blood, bit into the crook of her arm, tearing out skin, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilcox went to a local hospital emergency room and then fled to her mother’s home. She eventually ended the relationship with the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilcox considers herself lucky. “I could’ve easily ended up one of the women on my own list.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/trail-missing-american-indian-women/571657/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: On the trail of missing American Indian women&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, she is married to a man who says his wife’s work has opened his eyes to the pervasiveness of violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She’s inspired me,” says Mike Nosenzo, who married Wilcox in 2018. “The amount of time that she spends on it, the dedication that she puts into it—I don’t see how I could feel any other way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her project nears the two-year mark, Wilcox wants to dig deeper to find more details on the lives of these women before their deaths: How many of the women had a protective order against their assailant? And how many cases involved a prior history of domestic violence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is here, she said, not only to remember these women, but to make people care about their fate, with the hope of raising awareness to save others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like these women were completely failed by all of us, really,” Wilcox says. “A lot of these women did everything you’re supposed to do to keep themselves safe. They told people, they went to the police, they got protective orders, and it still was not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post appears courtesy of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://khn.org/"&gt;Kaiser Health News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/MKYH2CfCfHw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Natalie Schreyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/natalie-schreyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Kaiser Health News</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/kaiser-health-news/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/AP_17284613059015/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Ken Miller / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">A School Nurse Is on a Mission to Count the Women Killed by Men</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/MKYH2CfCfHw/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-16T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T13:03:23-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582769</id><summary type="html">Dawn Wilcox is building a public database of the victims murdered by lovers, neighbors, fathers, and strangers.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/building-public-database-murdered-women/582769/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Long before the future leaders of America were &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/northam-press-conference-789192/"&gt;moonwalking with shoe polish smeared on their cheeks&lt;/a&gt;, the first blackface minstrels took to the stage in the early 19th century. Beginning in the decades leading up to the Civil War, troupes of white men, women, and children darkened their faces with burnt cork and traveled the country performing caricatures of blackness through songs, dances, and skits. These performances, arising out of Pittsburgh, Louisville, Cincinnati, and other cities along the Ohio River, became one of America’s first distinct art forms and its most popular genre of public entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;From the beginning, minstrelsy attracted criticism for its racist portrayals of African Americans. Frederick Douglass &lt;a href="http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/minstrel/miar03bt.html"&gt;decried&lt;/a&gt; blackface performers as “the filthy scum of white society, who have stolen from us a complexion denied to them by nature, in which to make money, and pander to the corrupt taste of their white fellow citizens.” In venues where black artists were often banned from performing and black audiences, if they were admitted at all, were forced to occupy segregated sections, white entertainers in blackface furthered the same paternalistic and degrading stereotypes that plantation owners and politicians advanced to justify slavery, and helped create a racist symbology that came to represent generations of prejudice. Shows featured a cast of recurring characters: the clownish slave Jim Crow; the obsequious, maternal Mammy; the hypersexualized wench Lucy Long; the arrogant dandy Zip Coon; the lazy, childish Sambo. Some of these archetypes continue to surface in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There’s always been a resistance to it, in part because it was so demeaning,” says Lisa M. Anderson, who has studied the history of minstrelsy and other performances of race as a professor at Arizona State University. “The shows really were set up to demean blackness and black people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But to many white audiences and entertainers, the performances seemed innocuous, fun, even esteemable in their representation of African Americans. Early audiences were composed mainly of white working-class people and recent immigrants, for whom, Anderson says, the exaggerated characters onstage enhanced a feeling of racial superiority and belonging—and provided cheap, accessible entertainment. The shows reflected back a foolish, animalistic image of blackness that was already ingrained in the national culture; the racism was so familiar to observers that it could be lauded as artistic or progressive, or even overlooked entirely. That indulgent ignorance has followed blackface through decades of criticism and transformation, and into the present day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; articles from the late 1860s provide insight into minstrelsy’s heyday in the mid-19th century. In an article from our November 1867 issue, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1867/11/stephen-c-foster-and-negro-minstrelsy/582439/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Robert P. Nevin describes&lt;/a&gt; the form’s early development with an admiration largely divorced from consideration of its sociopolitical context or implications. He viewed successful minstrel performances as accurate portrayals of African American culture and mannerisms, praising their ability to retain “unimpaired … such original excellences as Nature in Sambo shapes and inspires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He lamented what he saw as the temporary failure of performers in the 1830s and ’40s to live up to this goal. “The intuitive utterance of the arts was misapprehended or perverted altogether,” he recalled. “Gibberish became the staple of its composition. Slang phrases and crude jests, all odds and ends of vulgar sentiment, without regard to the idiosyncrasies of the negro, were caught up, jumbled together into rhyme, and, rendered into the lingo presumed to be genuine, were ready for the stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But ultimately he devoted his article to praising the songwriter Stephen C. Foster, who began writing for minstrel shows in the 1850s and, in Nevin’s eyes, elevated the performances to a position of new respect. Rather than embodying only “the vulgar notion of the negro as a man-monkey,” Nevin wrote, Foster’s art “teemed with a nobler significance. It dealt, in its simplicity, with universal sympathies, and taught us all to feel with the slaves the lowly joys and sorrows it celebrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During this period of heightened popularity and respect, Ralph Keeler, then an adolescent boy who had fled his New York family, became enamored with minstrelsy and joined a traveling troupe. He described the experience in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1869/07/three-years-negro-minstrel/582436/?utm_source=feed"&gt;an 1869 article for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, charting his three years as a “youthful prodigy” who performed jigs, played female parts in “negro ballets,” and danced as a “wench” to the misogynistic “Lucy Long” song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To Keeler, the racial aspect of the performances seems incidental; his article makes almost no mention of the nature of the characters he played or his own understanding of blackness. Instead, he dwells on his development as an entertainer, on the excitement of finding a place in a troupe and traveling the country, and on his eventual disenchantment with playing to an audience. When the social and political dynamics of race do enter into his story, it comes off as more inadvertent than anything. He describes, for instance, a black man named Ephraim who began traveling with and serving the troupe, although he was repeatedly told that it couldn’t pay him for his labor, and who became an object of ridicule before being jailed for an altercation with an Irishman that he didn’t initiate. Introducing him partway through the article, Keeler cruelly describes Ephraim as “one of the most comical specimens of the negro species.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a more striking passage, Keeler recounts witnessing a mob lynching a man on a boat while traveling through the Midwest. The troupe arrived in the town of Cairo, Illinois, on the night that a group of white men decided to punish a black man who had been running a “gambling-saloon” on his “old wharf-boat” by the town levee. “At a given signal, the wharf-boat was set afire and cut adrift, and, as it floated out into the current, the vigilantes surrounded it in small boats, with their rifles ready and pointed to prevent the escape of their victim,” Keeler remembers. The minstrels and vigilantes watched as the boat exploded with the black man still on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The next day I spoke with the leader of the band in the small boats,” Keeler writes. “He even confessed that … he felt almost sorry for the victim, after the explosion had blown him into eternity.” Then the article moves on, without further reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Keeler does describe losing respect and enthusiasm for minstrelsy, though not because of any moral objection. Early on, he recalls, “I looked upon a great negro minstrel as unquestionably the greatest man on earth,” but later began “to doubt whether a great negro minstrel was a more enviable man than a great senator or author,” and he decided to leave the troupe to pursue a university education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Soon after Keeler’s stint in the shows, minstrelsy’s popularity began to decline, particularly in the North. Looking back from 1869, he begins by noting: “Negro minstrels were, I think, more highly esteemed at the time of which I am about to write than they are now; at least, I thought more of them then, both as individuals and as ministers to public amusement than I ever have since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But despite consistent resistance to the racist portrayals and the rise of more popular art forms, blackface performances persisted, becoming a part of vaudeville shows, radio programs, and television shows and movies as time went on. Only in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with increased public pressure from the civil-rights movement, did the form mostly disappear from stage and screen. But even then it remained a part of the national culture, a feature of parties, Halloween costumes, comedy sketches, and fashion that’s lingered on into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In part, Anderson says, white Americans might continue to wear blackface out of ignorance. “People don’t necessarily know the history of blackface minstrelsy,” she says. “They don’t necessarily even know that was a thing. They’ve seen blackface images, but they don’t know that’s where they came from. So there’s a kind of decontextualization of the place of blackface in our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But in some cases the choice seems to go beyond ignorance. The photo of two men standing side by side in blackface and a Ku Klux Klan robe, respectively, that appeared in Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s medical-school yearbook (without his knowledge, he now claims), is difficult to explain away by saying its racist implications were unclear; even if blackface has been decontextualized, the KKK robe remains unambiguously attached to the tradition of white supremacy that spawned it. And Virginia’s attorney general, Mark Herring, said in a statement about his own youthful experiment with blackface that it was “a minimization of a horrific history I knew well even then.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That horrific history can also be traced as a legacy of white ignorance, from the 1860s articles that fail to grapple with minstrelsy’s racial context and implications to the statements of frat boys and medical students and police officers who appear in blackface in photos that continue to crop up in the news now. But against a backdrop of consistent criticism and overt racism, some of that ignorance, then and now, appears willful—and some of it doesn’t appear to be ignorance at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/5TlXsazxlPU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Annika Neklason</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/annika-neklason/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/minstrel/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Frances Benjamin Johnston / Library of Congress</media:credit><media:description>Beginning in the 19th century, white performers wore blackface to perform in minstrel shows as stereotyped racial characters.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Blackface Was Never Harmless</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/5TlXsazxlPU/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-16T08:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-16T18:48:49-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582733</id><summary type="html">In 1869, an &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; writer remembered darkening his face with burnt cork and acting out exaggerated caricatures of blackness with little reflection on the racial oppression and violence around him.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/legacy-blackface-ralph-northam-didnt-understand/582733/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I would never have put Snoop and Tupac Shakur on the list of things that could potentially harm Senator Kamala Harris’s presidential bid. But this week, two of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time unwillingly played a part in the latest attack on Harris’s blackness, which came after the California Democrat’s appearance on the popular morning-radio show &lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris engaged in a 40-minute-plus, wide-ranging conversation with the hosts Charlamagne Tha God, Angela Yee, and DJ Envy, detailing an agenda focused on issues disproportionately affecting African Americans: the staggering rate at which black women are dying in childbirth, mass incarceration, and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Harris, her stances on these matters were drowned out by a dumb &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-says-she-listened-to-snoop-dogg-tupac-while-smoking-weed-in-college-years-before-they-made-music"&gt;headline&lt;/a&gt;. Call it #AllEyezOnMeGate. Charlamagne asked Harris whether she’d ever smoked marijuana. She admitted that she’d smoked in college—and did indeed inhale. At some point, Envy asked Harris about her favorite music. But before she could respond, Charlamagne jokingly asked Harris about what she liked to listen to when she imbibed. Harris laughed off Charlamagne’s question and instead told Envy that some of her favorite artists were Snoop and ’Pac. She also mentioned her affinity for Cardi B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/kamala-harris-wants-demonstrate-strength/581425/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Kamala Harris’s show of strength&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the story went viral, the takeaway was that Harris had smoked marijuana while listening to ’Pac and Snoop. With the help of the typical rush to judgment on social media, and some masterful framing by &lt;i&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/i&gt;, a fake controversy was born. The claim was that Harris lied about her weed experience to curry favor with the black community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the critics bothered to watch her entire &lt;i&gt;Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; interview, they would have seen just how foolish these assumptions were. But then again, since Harris announced her decision to run for president, the attacks on her blackness have only seemed to gain momentum. Why would it change now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s always problematic to try to define blackness, but the strange part about the reaction to Harris is that her identity and motives are being challenged by both sides. One reason her campaign booked her on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;i&gt;Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; was that it reportedly saw this as a sound strategy to send a direct signal to those African Americans who just don’t trust that Harris is being authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she announced that she was running for president at her alma mater, Howard University, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the moment should have been touching and significant. Instead, there was a bubbling sentiment that Harris was, again, doing that only to suck up to African Americans. Forget about her personal connection to Howard, or how a black woman running for president extends the legacy of the civil-rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/lefts-trump-sized-tax-plans/573328/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Annie Lowrey: Kamala Harris’s Trump-size tax plan&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris should be questioned about her record as a senator and an attorney general, and her tenure as San Francisco’s district attorney, but too much of the conversation about her is instead dominated by insecurities that have nothing to do with determining whether she would be a good president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economist and author Boyce Watkins, who is black, tweeted, “If #KamalaHarris went to an #HBCU, what do you think led her to marry a white man?” Harris had to address this in her &lt;i&gt;Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; interview. She said she’s married to her white husband because she loves him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nod to the racist birther conspiracy that enveloped President Barack Obama, a tweet claiming that Harris wasn’t eligible to run for president because of her immigrant parents went viral. It has been repeated as fact so often that Harris is now forced to explain her ethnic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was nothing learned from Obama’s run for president? He faced the same inane, pointless questions about his mixed-race identity as Harris. Just like Obama, Harris has exposed narrow-minded views of blackness with her presidential run. Harris is a multiracial woman who was born in Oakland, went to high school in Montreal, and worshipped with both Hindus and Baptists. She’s a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and yet, by her account, knows how to make an incredible Bolognese and a mean pot of collard greens. If the criterion for running for president is being authentically American, people have to accept that this is what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think they don’t understand who black people are, because if you do, if you walked on Hampton’s campus or Howard’s campus, or Morehouse, or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as black people,” Harris said on &lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt;. “So I’m not going to spend my time trying to educate people about who black people are. Some folks have a limited vision of who we are as black people. That’s on them. That’s not on us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/z0RvwcPmw-Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Jemele Hill</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/jemele-hill/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTS2CH8W/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Leah Millis / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Kamala Harris’s Blackness Isn’t Up for Debate</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/z0RvwcPmw-Y/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-16T06:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-16T11:47:17-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582982</id><summary type="html">Her identity and motives are being unfairly challenged on all sides.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/kamala-harris-didnt-lie-about-listening-snoop-dogg/582982/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;What We’re Following&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Donald Trump did end up calling for a national emergency,&lt;/strong&gt; in order to get the funds to build his border wall.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s a consequential announcement, but one that was temporarily dulled by the president’s rambling, chaotic speech. He ad-libbed on the threat posed by gangs and criminal cartels—and even undermined his own case for the move by saying that he made the call &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-emergency-declaration/582904/?utm_source=feed"&gt;out of political expediency, not necessity.&lt;/a&gt; The controversial decision now faces a dicey legal challenge ahead, but &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-state-of-emergency/582913/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum argues that’s only one of the potential roadblocks the president faces.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At a speech in Warsaw this week, Vice President Mike Pence took an unusual approach: blasting America’s allies.&lt;/strong&gt; Top officials from Germany and France neglected to show up to the conference, which featured representatives from more than 60 countries, because its aim was to criticize Iran and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-administration-cant-get-united-front-against-iran/582877/?utm_source=feed"&gt;support America’s reimposition of nuclear-related sanctions on the country.&lt;/a&gt; That comes after the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, a repudiation of Trump’s predecessor’s policies. Under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the administration has doubled down on the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/01/pompeo-obama-cairo-mideast-trump/580024/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Obama-era move to disengage militarily from the Middle East.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twitter may be the president’s social-media platform of choice, but for users, it’s dizzying to follow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;That was made acutely clear in a high-profile, 90-minute chat on the site between Jack Dorsey, the company’s enigmatic CEO, and the tech journalist Kara Swisher: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/its-impossible-follow-conversation-twitter/582907/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The discussion was clunky and difficult to parse&lt;/a&gt;, degrading Twitter’s goal of connecting people and letting them follow conversations. That’s not the only flack Twitter has gotten of late—it has a festering harassment and abuse problem that it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/twitter-keeps-rolling-out-features-but-not-the-ones-that-matter/569296/?utm_source=feed"&gt;exceedingly slow to address.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/saahil-desai/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Saahil Desai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evening Read&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/friendship-files-great-british-bake-offs-selasi-and-val/581578/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Friendship Baked in the Great British Bake Off Tent" height="378" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/lead_720_405_20/e984b143a.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Wenjia Tang / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selasi Gbormittah and Val Stones, two former contestants on the beloved show &lt;em&gt;The Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;, forged an unpredictable intergenerational friendship, which they’ve maintained since that season of the show stopped filming in 2016. In The Friendship Files&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a newly launched weekly Q&amp;amp;A featuring a pair of unusual friends, Julie Beck talks with both of them about the relationship:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you remember your first impressions of each other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I was very late, so they're all thinking, Who's this guy who is late? He's gonna be a problem. I turned up really late on my motorbike. I was soaking wet and I just smiled. I don't think I even apologized. I just said, “Hey, I'm here for the baking show.” And everyone looked at me like, Who the hell is this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: You walked in in your gear and I remember thinking, Ah, it's that young man that I saw.

I interview the friends at the same time, to capture their unique dynamic together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two high-school friends &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/returning-friends-sweatshirt-after-20-years/582427/?utm_source=feed"&gt;reunited by a sweater&lt;/a&gt; after spending decades apart; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/friendship-files-great-british-bake-offs-selasi-and-val/581578/?utm_source=feed"&gt;contestants&lt;/a&gt; from The Great British Bake Off who bonded over motorcycles and baked goods, despite the generation gap between them; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/friendship-files-meeting-bumble-bff/581575/?utm_source=feed"&gt;two women who moved to a new city&lt;/a&gt; and found each other on a dating app; and four students who &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/friendship-files-when-teacher-becomes-friend/582430/?utm_source=feed"&gt;remain close with their favorite high-school teacher&lt;/a&gt; after graduation—these stories reflect the warmth and generosity, as well as the hardships and challenges that friendships bring to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know would like to be a part of the series, send a nomination to &lt;a href="http://friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com/"&gt;friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/julie-beck/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Julie Beck&lt;/a&gt;, senior editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Friendship Baked in the Great British Bake Off Tent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Bakeoff1/e42fba70e.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Selasi Gbormittah (left) and Val Stones (right). Courtesy of Val Stones. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you remember how you two, specifically, became friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: During downtime or when we were at the hotel I used to talk to Val a lot, and in the green room. I think our common interests came into play, because I found out that Val loved motorbikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I had a motorbike license before Selasi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that's when the friendship really began. Also because I love whiskey—Val brought me two tiny bottles of whiskey from a distillery onto the set for me, which I still haven't drank. They're still at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I've got some more samples for you, but you're gonna have to come over here to drink them ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite OAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: What is OAP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Old-age pensioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: A person who is past 60 and getting retirement pension. I'm his favorite OAP. And I've always said that Selasi is my favorite adopted son ... He watches his swearing with me, just like he would his grandma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Money can’t buy you love, but it can buy you a fairy-tale wedding. &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;fellow Natalie Escobar visited a wedding expo, which featured a range of businesses from &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/wedding-expos-reveal-a-lot-about-americans-ideals-of-romance/582421/?utm_source=feed"&gt;bakeries and dress shops to barbecue-sauce stands and dance lessons.&lt;/a&gt; The expo’s consumerist bonanza shows the wedding industry’s choke hold on middle-class couples tying the knot: Most couples will spend  $15,000 to $35,000 on a wedding, often adding to existing debt from student loans or mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ahead of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s Ashley Fetters &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/westminster-dog-show-families/582322/?utm_source=feed"&gt;follows a mother-daughter team that’s been showing dogs together for nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;. Eighteen-year-old Becca Flood and her mother, Mara, breed collies, spending hours on end to breed them, train them, and groom them for the show. Now that Becca is off at college three hours away from home, she and her mother are getting used to a new routine—for Becca, a life without pets for the first time, and for her mother, attending shows without her daughter and most trusted partner. And of course, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/02/backstage-westminster-dog-show-photos/582562/?utm_source=feed"&gt;many, many photos of the Floods and their dogs, including Cherry (whose full name is SugarNSpice Cherry On Top) and Poe (Travler SugarNSpice Witches Do Come Blue).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You might feel hurt that she hasn’t reached out, but she’s likely holding on to years of pain and hurt as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You can start with a sincere apology. A sincere apology is heartfelt and empathic and entirely about the person receiving it. A letter in this spirit might go something like this: “I owe you an apology, and I wish I’d offered it much sooner. I know that I’ve hurt you deeply, and I’m truly sorry for that. I would like to know more about your experience, because I’ve come to realize that I failed to see earlier that I put you through a lot of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

He also plans to reallocate approximately $8 billion in agency funds. Many Republicans have expressed misgivings about the move, and Trump’s decision serves as &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trumps-emergency-declaration-is-a-test-for-republicans/582856/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a test of their willingness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to oppose the president. In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said they’ll take action “in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, in his speech, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-emergency-declaration/582904/?utm_source=feed"&gt;seemed to undermine his own case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for the national emergency: “I can do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this,” the president said. And as promised, California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Friday that he is &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/430251-california-to-sue-trump-over-border-wall-emergency-declaration"&gt;preparing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. “President Trump is manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up ‘national emergency’ in order to seize power and subvert the constitution,” Newsom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are You a Citizen?:&lt;/strong&gt; The Supreme Court &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/15/692656180/supreme-court-to-decide-if-2020-census-includes-citizenship-question"&gt;has agreed to decide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; whether a question about citizenship status can be added to the 2020 census.

“Every additional dollar he devotes to the border is a dollar taken from another project already approved by Congress. Every one of those projects has patrons and sponsors. And because most military contracting goes to red states, most of the reshuffled dollars will be removed from red states.” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-state-of-emergency/582913/?utm_source=feed"&gt;→ Read on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/governor-newsom-addresses-californias-housing-crisis/582892/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Gavin Newsom’s Big Idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Reihan Salam)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Not long ago ... the governor of California was dismissed as a showboating opportunist who cared more about climbing the political ladder than he did about the finer details of public policy. But his decision to abandon the dream of a high-speed train that would ferry passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco, at least for now, suggests that he’s made of sterner stuff. ” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/governor-newsom-addresses-californias-housing-crisis/582892/?utm_source=feed"&gt;→ Read on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/furor-over-ilhan-omars-tweets-shows-unhealthy-israel-discourse/582859/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Stop Alleging Anti-Semitism to Score Political Points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jeremy Ben-Ami)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Being afforded the space for criticism brings with it an obligation on the part of ... critics to think about the impact of their words—and tweets. And critics of the critics should be called to task when their rhetoric crosses the line to Islamophobia and racism.” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/furor-over-ilhan-omars-tweets-shows-unhealthy-israel-discourse/582859/?utm_source=feed"&gt;→ Read on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-national-security-threat/582934/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Trump Crosses the Rubicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Noah Rothman)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Let’s not mince words: backing Trump in this moment is not the prerogative of an institutionalist, which the majority leader claims to be. It is the prerogative of a partisan operator motivated, above all, by deference to a fleeting political imperative: avoiding another government shutdown.” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-national-security-threat/582934/?utm_source=feed"&gt;→ Read on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/ilhan-omar-elliott-abrams-and-el-mozote-massacre/582889/?utm_source=feed"&gt;I Will Never Forget El Mozote.

“At the Roman Catholic church in El Mozote, soldiers separated men from their families, took them away, and shot them. They herded mothers and children into the convent.

Even then, the anticlimactic unveiling raised only more speculation about the true state of Donald Trump’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 8, Trump underwent a physical exam, according to the White House, which afterward released a brief press &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1094006319311474688"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; that said it was from the president’s new physician, Sean Conley. But the authorship of this report is questionable for several reasons, one of which is the sentence “The president is very grateful for the outstanding care he received today, and he especially wants to thank the doctors, nurses, enlisted and civilian staff who participated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be unheard-of for a doctor to praise himself in such a statement. Odder still is the subsequent assertion that Trump is “in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond.” This sort of long-term prediction is atypical for any physician, much less one whose only charge is to assess the president’s ability to execute the duties of the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/ethics-of-self-assessment/559427/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The problem with Trump dictating his own medical assessment&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would inspire more confidence in the objectivity of the process if just once a doctor would simply share Trump’s test results in a transparent way. This has not been the case at any point in Trump’s presidency, during which his health reports have been inconsistent and sprinkled with—if not entirely written in—sensational prose. As a result, the credibility of the presidential health-assessment process and the professionals involved have entered a free fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first physical as a candidate was reportedly performed by his former doctor, Harold Bornstein. After a year of journalistic scrutiny and national ire over the odd assessment (in which Trump was declared “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency”), Bornstein &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-doc-says-trump-bodyguard-lawyer-raided-his-office-took-n870351"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the president last year of dictating the assessment—and of sending associates to “raid” his office and take possession of his medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump underwent a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/questions-oz-trump/499469/?utm_source=feed"&gt;mock evaluation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dr. Oz Show&lt;/em&gt;, in which Oz spent most of the hour letting Trump say that he was doing great. Oz was later &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40568706/heres-why-dr-oz-is-an-absurd-choice-for-trumps-health-council"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; by Trump to his Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, despite being called before &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/magic-weight-loss-pills-may-not-exist/372958/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Congress and castigated for unethical behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Trump’s new physician, Ronny Jackson (before being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/ronny-jackson-veterans-affairs.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;amp;module=first-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news"&gt;embroiled in scandal&lt;/a&gt;), gave an audience-of-one-themed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-trumps-doctor-okay/2018/01/17/0d887f50-fbce-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html?utm_term=.e38d887ac435"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; peppered with the words &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; incredible&lt;/em&gt; and suggested that Trump could live to 200 because he has such excellent genes. (“Hands down, there’s no question that he is in the excellent range … I put out in the statement that the president’s health is excellent, because his overall health is excellent … Overall, he has very, very good health. Excellent health … incredible cardiac fitness … He has incredible genes … He has incredibly good genes, and it’s just the way God made him.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Jackson was nominated by Trump to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health-care system, the nation’s largest, despite having &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/03/ronny-jackson-va/556799/?utm_source=feed"&gt;no experience in health-care policy or administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/trump-cog-decline/548759/?utm_source=feed"&gt;written with regard to evaluating Trump’s mental health&lt;/a&gt;, it is historically unprofessional for doctors to speculate from afar. But in the absence of a transparent process, even though it’s not possible to make a comprehensive assessment, it’s possible to say more than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/12/trump-physical-health/547856/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How much will we find out about Trump’s health?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we do know: The president is 72 years old, and he is widely reported to sleep little. He &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/trumps-unfitness/526677/?utm_source=feed"&gt;avoids exercise&lt;/a&gt; because of his erroneous belief that it “depletes energy.” He has evidence of coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/17/health/trump-heart-disease-gupta/index.html"&gt;coronary arterial calcium score&lt;/a&gt; done last year. He takes a cholesterol-lowering medication because of a history of high cholesterol. He is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/health/trump-physical-results-2019-bn/index.html"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt; and eats a lot of junk (specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/12/trump-eats/547355/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Filet-O-Fish&lt;/a&gt;). He is regularly described in palace-intrigue stories as “&lt;a href="https://www.google.com.br/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=v-RmXMz7F4Kc_QaZlpyoDQ&amp;amp;q=trump+%22increasingly+isolated%22&amp;amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;amp;oq=trump+%22increasingly+isolated%22&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1454.5838..6158...0.0..0.188.1663.28j1......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0j0i131.20dkV9v2PEY"&gt;increasingly isolated&lt;/a&gt;,” and he is under as much professional stress as it’s possible for a person to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no suggestion here that he’s physically unfit to execute the duties of the office, but it’s also unclear on what basis any doctor could deem that “very good health.” As in the past, there’s little evidence that this assessment is not primarily about good publicity—about outcome, not process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/jbXNhMvhyUc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>James Hamblin</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-hamblin/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/AP_19015040117819/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Susan Walsh / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Will Trump Live to 500?</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/jbXNhMvhyUc/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T14:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T15:53:31-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582919</id><summary type="html">The president underwent an extensive physical exam this week.

Both losses and insights come from being politically homeless, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/i-left-gop-because-trump/581965/?utm_source=feed"&gt;he wrote last week&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The main thing I’ve gained in unfastening myself from the GOP is critical distance and detachment. One can see certain things from outside the silo that one cannot see within it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a lifelong Republican, I pretty much agreed with every sentiment Wehner expressed. And it meant something to me, living in a world where I feel increasingly alone, because I am unwilling to align myself with my fellow Republicans who have doubled down on Trump’s brand of crazy, and yet unwanted by a Democratic Party hell-bent on its own brand of extremism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I don’t know what that means for me, but for now it’s at least somewhat comforting knowing I am not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grey Proctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ridgefield, Wash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Peter Wehner makes the point that only once he left the Republican Party was he able to view issues outside of the tribal lens. I believe that this may be the critical issue of our day: We have enabled partisanship to the point that all issues are now forced into a tribal argument. Honest conversations are no longer relevant. How can we choose the right path for America while we are busy looking to see which party has the most to gain? Everyone looks to a leader who can unite us, but I think the problem is within ourselves. When all is said and done, every single one of us has a solemn responsibility to truth and morality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diane M. Sloan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaumburg, Ill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Peter Wehner’s “What I’ve Gained by Leaving the Republican Party” resonates with me. I am a former conservative evangelical minister. I now consider myself a Christian nonbeliever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wehner focuses mainly on the tribal impact—the willingness to overlook certain flaws in fellow tribal members, to give them the benefit of the doubt when they don’t live up to tribal ideals. He eschews, at least for himself, the idea of automatic blinding to other points of view, but does praise the concept of critical distance detachment. “One can see certain things from outside the silo that one cannot see within it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In conservative Christianity, belief is the litmus test. One is continually fussing about what it is they believe about something and seeking out others who believe what and like they do. Belief is not a benign thing; it is, like membership in a political party, a choice, a commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While I was pastoring in my church, despite my own predilections for study, I knew there were some things I just could not research or analyze in depth. To do so would risk arriving at contrary positions to my church. I deliberately avoided thinking about things so that I could with integrity continue to affirm commitment to the Statement of Faith of my denomination and church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once I left, I reveled in the freedom to explore these things knowing that my employment and my status were no longer attached to them in the same way. My thinking on these items has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wehner’s article is a call for freedom. Freedom to explore, think, and be different. Tribes do not tolerate freedom. When they do, they risk a metamorphosis of the tribe, and that may not be what they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew R. McGinn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I applaud Peter Wehner for having the guts to question the foundation of his entire adult life. I did the same thing myself (although it was half my life ago, around the age of 20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family’s deep Catholicism denied me access to sex ed and birth control. I didn’t want to burn in hell, of course, so I didn’t think for myself and just go out and get it. Instead, I thought, how would I get through the phalanx of Planned Parenthood opponents whom I knew (through being forced by my mom to pray the rosary with them every Sunday at the same clinic)? But really I was afraid. Isn’t an abortion clinic where women go to die? Where they are murdered by rich and calculating abortionists? As a pregnant teen, I often thought I’d be better off if I just drove really fast into a brick wall, but I couldn’t quite get up the bravery required. So I looked through the pile of wannabe adoptive parents—thoughtfully provided by the pro-life folks—and looked through the legal contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;My son is now 22. We both volunteer for Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is great that Mr. Wehner found compassion and regret in looking back at the Willie Horton ads. I hope that he will meet more women who tell them their late-term abortion nightmare stories so that he will be able to one day have compassion for them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joan Vignocchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Santa Barbara, Calif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thoughtful editorial; helped me clarify my own thinking. Unfortunately, insight and distance aren’t enough to offset the immense grief of having arrived at where we find ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Koloc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eagan, Minn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mr. Wehner is more a part of a growing group of people in this country than he realizes. His views on his party have been reflected by more than a few on the left as well, but many, including me, are fearful of voicing their views. The left hands out harsh criticism to anyone who disagrees with it. As a woman of color and a veteran of the very liberal world of Hollywood, I have realized that I, too, have no political home base anymore. But I simply cannot look away from what I see. Donald Trump is a product of deeper problems in this country, and the left ultimately put him in power. If they aren’t careful, they are going to do it again. Mr. Wehner is in good company, and I’m glad he isn’t the only one questioning. Please thank him for having the guts to put his piece out there. And yes, there are people on the other side doing exactly what he is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina Nelson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;North Hollywood, Calif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/SgjgvpOqx-k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/15885v/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Library of Congress</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Letters: ‘Tribes Do Not Tolerate Freedom’</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/SgjgvpOqx-k/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T14:24:50-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T14:26:22-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582640</id><summary type="html">Readers react to Peter Wehner’s reflection on what he’s gained by leaving the Republican Party—and discuss how tribalism has shaped the political debate.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/letters/archive/2019/02/readers-respond-what-ive-gained-by-leaving-the-republican-party/582640/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Valentine’s Day among humans and animals, fashion in New York City, dogs at play and in competition, a peasant-revolt reenactment in Croatia, family reunions at an Indian border fence, an icy dinosaur in Latvia, the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, snow kayaking in Estonia, International Condom Day in Mexico City, and much more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/lY9eUxQDToQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Alan Taylor</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/alan-taylor/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/02/photos-week-2/w01_1097533778-1/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Kevin Winter / Getty for The Recording Academy</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Photos of the Week: Lego Bugatti, Snowy Seattle, Cattle Dating</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/lY9eUxQDToQ/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T14:23:31-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T15:26:47-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:260-582910</id><summary type="html">Valentine’s Day among humans and animals, family reunions at an Indian border fence, an icy dinosaur in Latvia, snow kayaking in Estonia, International Condom Day in Mexico City, and much more</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/02/photos-of-the-week-lego-bugatti-snowy-seattle-cattle-dating/582910/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;PARIS—It’s the most bananas artistic undertaking of this century. &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;, as the project is known, is a Soviet thought experiment that brings together A-list artists, world-class scientists, a handful of famous actors, Cambridge Analytica (almost), and a lot of Russian money to create 13 feature-length films, as well as an online experience and a rich auxiliary cultural program. &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/stalinist-truman-show-artist-paid-400-people-to-live-as-soviet-citizens"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; a “Stalinist &lt;em&gt;Truman Show&lt;/em&gt;.” And so when &lt;a href="https://www.dau.com/?utm_source=googleAdwords&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brandkeysfr&amp;amp;utm_term=dau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had its world premiere here in Paris last month after more than a decade in the works and years of ambient avant-garde buzz, I figured I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; films are on view until February 17 inside two of Paris’s main public theaters, the Théâtre de la Ville and the Théâtre du Châtelet, which are open 24 hours a day for the event. If you show up as the pale winter sun is rising, you’re likely to bump into people just leaving after a night of carousing. The event features pop-up concerts (Robert del Naja from Massive Attack, Brian Eno), seminars (the writer Jonathan Littell, French academics), drinks (wine, vodka, Cognac, kvass), and food (borscht, gloppy Russian salads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some rooms in one theater are decorated like Soviet communal apartments, and visitors can hang out there, occasionally with members of the &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; cast. Another theater has a room set up like a Berlin sex club. As part of the project, priests, rabbis, imams, shamans, and psychologists are on call to discuss people’s experiences of &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; and to film their responses, which visitors can opt to archive or delete. Centre Pompidou, Paris’s preeminent modern-art museum, has also joined the &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; bandwagon. Inside the Russian-art section is an enclosure furnished like a Soviet apartment, where two people posing as &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; scientists live around the clock. Visitors can watch them read or pace around, like animals at the zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;DAU’&lt;/em&gt;s producers and editors, and some of its celebrity-artist guests, the project has become a vibrant creative and intellectual community, even a way of life. To anyone outside it, the project can seem unwelcoming. I’ve spent many long hours visiting &lt;em&gt;DAU &lt;/em&gt;since it opened here on January 24, and I’ve found the films at turns maddening, boring, and pornographic. I’ve never encountered a project whose monumental, megalomaniacal ambitions are so dramatically at odds with the uneven final product. Although maybe that’s the point. Maybe it’s all a big metaphor for the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="423" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/6_13a_36/03a1c8bc3.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A scene inside &lt;em&gt;DAU’&lt;/em&gt;s Institute&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Olympia Orlova / Phenomen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; began rather modestly around 2005 when the Russian film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky, who is now 43, set out to make his second feature, a biopic about the Russian theoretical physicist &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1962/landau/biographical/"&gt;Lev Landau&lt;/a&gt;—hence &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;—who won a Nobel Prize in 1962, and whose open marriage made for rich material. Somewhere along the line, after the cameras had already begun rolling in St. Petersburg, “I understood that everything I created was bullshit, and I immediately had to stop and change everything,” Khrzhanovsky told me when I spoke to him recently in Paris. “It was a Dostoevskian moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He veered away from the biopic, for which the dystopian Russian novelist&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/the-blizzard-vladimir-sorokin-review/420804/?utm_source=feed"&gt; Vladimir Sorokin&lt;/a&gt; had written the screenplay, got what seems like a blank check from &lt;a href="https://www.phenomentrust.org/founder/"&gt;Sergei Adoniev,&lt;/a&gt; a Russian businessman who’s made a fortune in telecommunications and is still the project’s main backer, and began to dream big. So big that Khrzhanovsky moved to Kharkov, Ukraine, built a replica of a top-secret Soviet research facility, and commissioned about 400 people to live and work there for two years and reenact 30 years of Soviet history, from 1938 to 1968. The participants had to wear their period costumes even when the cameras weren’t rolling. More than 350,000 people auditioned. From 2009 to 2011, the director shot more than 700 hours of raw footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became a &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/movie-set-that-ate-itself-dau-ilya-khrzhanovsky"&gt;crazy game&lt;/a&gt;, in which Khrzhanovsky made the rules. But the set began to take on a life of its own, one that seemed to echo the &lt;a href="https://www.prisonexp.org/the-story"&gt;Stanford Prison Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, in which students were told to act as prison guards and got overzealous about the job. The &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; films had no script, only guided improvisation. The line between reality and fiction began dissolving. Offscreen and on, the participants fell in love, and more than a dozen babies were born. They also all signed nondisclosure agreements, Khrzhanovsky told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teodor Currentzis, a Greek Russian conductor, plays the Landau-inspired character, Dau, in the films. The director cast Radmila Shchegoleva, the only professional actor in the core group, to play Dau’s wife, Kora. Before filming began, Khrzhanovsky had Shchegoleva spend a year preparing for the role, working in a chocolate factory and living in a communal apartment as Kora had done. The artists Marina Abramovic and Carsten Höller and the theater director Peter Sellars made cameos (Abramovic &lt;a href="https://www.dau.com/about/participants?locale=en_GB"&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; a visiting anatomy professor in the year 1956). &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/jim_fallon"&gt;James Fallon&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who specializes in psychopaths and the nature of aggression, made repeat visits playing the part of an academic. In one film, he has a gripping discussion about the gulag with Vladimir Azhippo, a former KGB officer who also played one in &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their meticulous period reconstructions, the films operate as a critique of the Soviet regime, but also exude a genuine nostalgia for it. It was hard to pin down Khrzhanovsky about his aims, but Ilya Permyakov, one of three editors for the films, who also organizes conferences central to the project’s afterlife, spoke of &lt;em&gt;DAU &lt;/em&gt;as a spiritual exploration, one that asks: “What is a human being? What elements of the infernal do I contain in me?” He called the project “not a historical reconstruction but a parallel multiverse,” and referred to it as “a place of self-rebirth” and a “confessional experience” where you can ask, “What is my alter ego? What did I hide from myself?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outset, there have been complaints about the project’s working conditions. The writer Michael Idov visited the set in 2011 after hearing stories about the “survivalist camps” environment, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/movie-set-that-ate-itself-dau-ilya-khrzhanovsky"&gt;and wrote a vivid, unsettling account in &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some participants told Idov they thought their apartments had hidden cameras filming them at all times. Khrzhanovsky told me he’d installed the hidden cameras but never activated them and never forced anyone to do anything against his or her will. It was all a game, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a former casting assistant for the &lt;em&gt;DAU &lt;/em&gt;films, Albina Kovalyova, &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2019/01/24/lights-cameras-madness-troubling-journey-inside-dau-disturbing/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; that she’d had a mental breakdown on the set and thought Kyrzhanovsky had crossed a line “from fictional abuse to the real thing.” She was afraid babies had been tortured during the shoot. Kyrzhanovsky assured me no babies had been harmed. He made it seem as if the controversy was part of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="626" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/locations_24/3f61c0215.jpg" width="416"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A scene inside &lt;em&gt;DAU’&lt;/em&gt;s Institute&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Olympia Orlova / Phenomen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filming ended in late 2011, when some neo-Nazis whom Khrzhanovsky invited from Moscow to spice up the narrative destroyed the film set, which the director had everyone refer to as “the Institute.” It was all captured in a &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; film that I’ve heard is engrossing. How could it not be? A Jewish director engaging with neo-Nazis. An artist turning the destruction of his own work into art, a not-so-subtle nod to &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mikhail-Bakunin"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt;, the 19th-century godfather of Russian anarchist thought. Perhaps it was the only way to end a film shoot that could have lasted forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of &lt;em&gt;DAU’s &lt;/em&gt;Paris venues have a schedule for the 13 films or any of the other events. If you showed up when Currentzis was in town and conducted his MusicAeterna ensemble in a breathless performance of Tchaikovsky, great. If you didn’t, tough luck. “It’s like a safari,” &lt;a href="http://chatelet-theatre.com/blog/ruth-mackenzie-et-thomas-lauriot-dit-prevost/"&gt;Ruth Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt;, a co-director of the Théâtre du Châtelet, which co-produced the event, told me. “You don’t buy a ticket to a safari and then complain if you didn’t see an elephant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before entering the theaters you have to check your cellphone at the door. Instead of tickets, visitors are granted “visas” for six hours, 24 hours, or multiple-entry across the length of the run. I got an unlimited visa, which meant answering a psychometric questionnaire. (I was told the results would be fed into a program that would create a personalized itinerary through the narratives based on my answers, although this system wasn’t yet working when I visited.) I was asked to respond to statements including: “I have engaged in deliberately self-destructive behaviors and not cared about the consequences,” “I have been in a relationship with an imbalance of power,” and “In the right situation, everyone could have the capacity to kill.” I rated each on a scale of seven, from “completely unrelated” to “completely related” or “completely disagree” to “completely agree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help design a program that would create viewing itineraries based on people’s answers to the questionnaire, &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;’s producers spoke with Cambridge Analytica, the&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline"&gt; now-infamous British political-data firm&lt;/a&gt; that was hired by Donald Trump’s campaign for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and which Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/special-counsel-studies-trump-campaign-ties-cambridge-analytics/story?id=53903252"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; for alleged misuse of the private data of Facebook’s 50 million users. But &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;’s executive producer, Martine d’Anglejan-Chatillon, told me they never hired the company. “They were just not very good,” she said. Instead, they hired &lt;a href="https://truth.ms/"&gt;Truth&lt;/a&gt;, a London-based agency that specializes in psychometric profiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat in a single-viewer booth in front of a screen divided into 16 windows, exploring different plotlines and finding more information about the central characters—a project called DAU Digital that will soon go live online. The images ranged from zany science experiments to tender love stories. In one window, scientists put men in a metal pyramid and shot invisible rays at the pyramid, then recorded the men’s responses. One compared the sensation to “a warm bath.” In another screen, a woman in a glass box mimicked a monkey in an adjoining box. There was a sex scene. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, playing himself, talked about Marxism as a kind of religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the film I liked best, because it had true emotional depth, Dau receives a visit from a friend of his youth, Maria, played by the Greek actress Maria Nafpliotou, and they talk about what might have been. Others are terminally boring, with little character development. In a film set in 1968, Kora washes her now-infirm husband in the tub, then makes dinner, pounding chicken cutlets for what seems like ages before frying them. Later, she lies in bed with the couple’s teenage son and kisses him on the lips. In this work at least, Kyrzhanovsky makes even incest seem dull.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="left"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="423" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/DAU_Phenomen_IP_2019_Photographer_Olympia_Orlova_7/148b2af65.jpg" width="638"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A scene inside &lt;em&gt;DAU’&lt;/em&gt;s Institute&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Olympia Orlova / Phenomen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The films that troubled me most were ones that I felt crossed a line. One featured two men who came across as mentally challenged and who spent much of the time fondling each other, naked. &lt;em&gt;Who were these men&lt;/em&gt;, I wondered, and &lt;em&gt;did they know what they were getting themselves into?&lt;/em&gt; (That piece has voice-overs in French and English by the actors Gérard Depardieu and Willem Dafoe, respectively; none of the movies has subtitles or background music.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another film featured a waitress named Natasha who drinks to excess with a bunch of scientists and winds up having what looked to me like actual, penetrative sex with the French scientist Luc Bigé. Because she’s slept with a foreigner, which is against the Institute’s rules, she’s called in for questioning by Azhippo, the real KGB agent. He then forces Natasha to strip naked, drink the better part of a bottle of Cognac, and perform graphic sexual acts on herself with the empty bottle, before making her sign a pledge to inform on the scientists&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “Remember,” he tells her, “we’re going to be friends, and you’re signing this confession of your own free will.” Afterwards, Natasha flirts with the agent and says she only signed because he had nice eyes. The French voice-over is by the actress Charlotte Rampling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sex and manipulation didn’t seem to serve any greater artistic purpose, even if the participants had joined the project of their own free will. Also, if &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; isn’t scripted, were we seeing real drinking, real puking, and real sex?, I asked Khrzhanovsky. “Yes,” he said, they were having actual sex. So what kind of direction had he given the characters? What’s the difference between art and pornography? “You should answer me,” he said. I told him I wasn’t the creator. We went around in circles a bit. “It is sex, but I think it doesn’t matter if it’s with penetration or without penetration. What matters is what happens between people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, here I disagree. If there’s one line between art and pornography, it’s the line between simulated sex and real sex. Before filming, had he asked Natasha if she was comfortable having sex on camera? “When you invite people to this kind of project, generally you have all possible forces there and of course you discuss about sex, about arrest, about words you cannot pronounce,” Khrzhanovsky said. He said Natasha was Ukrainian, and not a sex worker, and that she and Bigé, her onscreen lover, continue to be part of the project. “Why do people try to be more moral than the people who participate? It’s a question about the question,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we spoke, I could hear in the background the slightly menacing thrum of an industrial soundscape composed by Brian Eno, who said at the press preview that &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; was “the most insanely ambitious project” he’d ever been involved in. At times during our conversation, Khrzhanovsky would occasionally open a black book that he’d placed on the table, its spine facing me. I could see that it had been hollowed out and that he kept his cellphone inside. I found this nod to the old KGB tactic of hiding recording devices in books amusing—and emblematic of the multiple levels of irony in Khrzhanovsky’s project. He was self-consciously making fun of his Soviet affectations, while also embracing them. He was pretending to be a sadist, but also just might &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a sadist. He certainly seemed like a man with teenage fantasies about sex and control and way too big a budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="445" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/DAU_Phenomen_IP_2019_Photographer_Olympia_Orlova_3/559659d07.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A scene inside &lt;em&gt;DAU’&lt;/em&gt;s Institute&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Olympia Orlova / Phenomen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Mackenzie, the co-director of the Théâtre du Châtelet, if she’d seen anything in the &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; films that made her reconsider showing them, she said no. Some were “disturbing,” she said, but she stood by Khrzhanovsky’s vision and thought he had his “finger on the zeitgeist.” How?, I asked. She mentioned the #MeToo movement. “The boundaries of acceptable behavior are changing by the year in a way that I think is healthy,” Mackenzie said. “As a feminist, I absolutely applaud the chance to debate and discuss these things and confront them. And in my view, Ilya gives us this chance through his art.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, the stories we tell ourselves. I don’t think the &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; films start the slightest serious debate about #MeToo or anything related to it, except a debate about the director’s own attitudes toward women on and off the set. I kept thinking back to the Cognac-bottle scene. The only thing that seemed to distinguish that movie from pornography was the involvement of serious artists and scientists in other aspects of the project. Their reputations gave cover to something quite creepy. &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; is a cagey project that largely gets a pass because it poses as an artistic exploration of control, authoritarianism, and the exploitation of women, when what’s going on here might just be plain exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more time I spent in the hermetic universe of &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;, the more I began to think that, for all the hoopla, on some level Khrzhanovsky didn’t actually want to show it to the public. He had spent years editing the material from &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;’s headquarters in Central London. Now that he put it before an audience, it felt as if we were an inconvenience, treated with contempt. When I asked him where he thought the audience fit in, he told me, “This project exists only through the public.” People’s reactions “become a part of the project,” he said, citing how a &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; premiere planned in Berlin last fall was called off because the city wouldn’t let him build a replica of the Berlin Wall. Khrzhanovsky seemed to enjoy the negative reactions. He’s been &lt;a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/2019/01/27/03015-20190127ARTFIG00122-dau-une-salade-russe.php"&gt;getting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://judithbenhamouhuet.com/report/dau-its-a-shame-the-made-in-the-ussr-mega-installation-across-three-sites-has-paris-amazed-but-proves-underwhelming/"&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;DAU &lt;/em&gt;in Paris is a massive &lt;em&gt;Gesamtkunstwerk&lt;/em&gt; without much &lt;em&gt;Kunst&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a nightclub disguised as an art installation. It’s a party—and it makes you feel as if you’re not invited. &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt; is a case study in how word of mouth spreads among artists, and how the Paris cultural establishment will seemingly embrace any project that affirms its commitment to the avant-garde, no matter how grotesque or banal. The true work of art here may be that Khrzhanovsky managed to pull it off at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he glided out into the night, I asked Khrzhanovsky what he wanted visitors to take away from the project. “That they can feel something about themselves, and I don’t know what, because people are so different,” he said. I did feel something. That I have a high tolerance for art, a low tolerance for physical discomfort, and an even lower tolerance for bullshit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/LyZUyPK9LNs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Donadio</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/rachel-donadio/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/AWoiISdb/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Olympia Orlova / Phenomen</media:credit><media:description>A scene from inside &lt;em&gt;DAU&lt;/em&gt;'s Institute</media:description></media:content><title type="html">A Mind-Boggling Soviet Nostalgia Project</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/LyZUyPK9LNs/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T14:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T17:38:48-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582874</id><summary type="html">A confounding exhibition from the Russian film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky poses as an exploration of artistic control and authoritarianism.

We have had a negotiation going on for about two days. It’s going extremely well—who knows what that means because it only matters if we get it done, but we are very much working very closely with China and President Xi who I respect a lot, very good relationship that we have. And we are a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We are covering everything, all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn’t be done, whether it was theft or anything, anything, the unfairness. We have been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China. A lot of people think it is $506 billion. Some people think it is much more than that. We’re gonna be leveling the playing field. The tariffs are hurting China very badly. They don’t want them and frankly if we can make the deal, it would be my honor to remove them. But otherwise, we are having very many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury; we have never had that before with China. It has been very much of a one-way street. So that’s happening. And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country. They haven’t respected us for a long time, not for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The U.K. and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we are agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement. You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit and the complexity and the problems. But we have a very good trading relationship with U.K. and that has just been strengthened further. So with the U.K., we are continuing our trade. And we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by. We expect that the U.K. will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States—the relationship there also is very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate, and that’ll be announced over the next 24 hours, and many other things. A lot of positive things are going on. We’re working on a summit, and you know all about the summit. It’ll be in Vietnam. Hanoi. And we will be meeting in Hanoi. I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect, and I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A lot was done in the first summit. No more rockets going up, no more missiles going up. No more testing of nuclear. Take back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War. And we got back our hostages. But we hope we will be very much equally as successful. I’m in no rush for speed. We just don’t want testing. The sanctions, as you know, remain. Everything is remaining. China has been helping us and Russia has been helping us, and South Korea I think you can say has been—we have been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan, but China, Russia on the border have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing, and that’s okay, as per the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful, and I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim. We have also established a very good relationship which has never happened between him or his family and the United States. They have really taken advantage of the United States, billions of dollars has been paid to them, and we won’t let that happen. But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force and economic power. Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China, right smack in the middle, is phenomenal. And we think they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future. So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration is taking to confront a problem that we have right here at home. We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away, wars that we should have never been in in many cases, but we don’t control our own border. So we are going to confront the national-security crisis on our southern border. And we are going to do it one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We have to do it. Not because it was a campaign promise, which it is—was one of many, by the way, not my only one. We are rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before—you look at other economies, they are doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally. The market is up tremendously today. Not that that’s anything, because I’ll go back in and they’ll say the market went back down. But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created. We have all the records. We have every record, but we are getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records. So our country is doing very well economically, and we have done a lot. But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When you look and when you listen to politicians, in particular, certain Democrats, they say it all comes through the port of entry. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just a lie. It’s all a lie. They say walls don’t work. Walls work 100 percent. Whether it’s El Paso—I really was smiling because the other night I was in El Paso, we had a tremendous crowd, tremendous crowd, and I asked the people, many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas, and I asked, them, I said, “Let me ask you as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?” You were there, some of you. It was not only better, it was like 100 percent better. You know what they did. But that’s only one example. There were so many examples. In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, and they have 23 murders. That’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So everyone knows that walls work, and there are better examples than El Paso, frankly. You just take a look almost everywhere. Take a look at Israel. They are building another wall. Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me. Ninety-nine point nine percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That is what it would be with us, too. The only weakness is they go to the wall and go around the wall. They go around the wall and in, okay, that’s what it is. It’s very simple. And a big majority of the big drugs, the big drug loads don’t go through ports of entry. They can’t go through ports of entry. You can’t take big loads because you have people, you have some very capable people, the border patrol, law enforcement looking. You can’t take human traffic, women and girls, you can’t take them through ports of entry. You can’t have them tied up in the back seat of a car or a truck or a van. They open the door, they look. If they can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall. Everybody knows that. Nancy knows it. Chuck knows it. They all know it. It’s all a big lie. It’s a big con game. You don’t have to be very smart to know, you put up a barrier, the people come in and—that’s it, they can’t do anything, unless they walk left or right and they find an area where there is no barrier and they come into the United States. Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We have detained more people. Our border agents are doing such incredible work. Our military has been incredible. We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there. We fixed the wall, and we loaded it up with barbed wire. It is very successful. But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them. And it's very necessary. We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way. They just are in—they’re in the process of breaking up. We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We have been working with Mexico much better than ever before. I want to thank the president. I want to thank Mexico. They have their own problems. They have the largest number of murders that they have ever had in their history, almost 40,000 murders—40,000. They’ve got to straighten that out. I think they will. But I just want to thank the president, because he has been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up. We had one that was up to 15,000 people; it’s largely broken up. Others have gotten through. And in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying. If we didn’t have the wall up and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through. They would be welcome to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the things we saved a tremendous, just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military. Well—we don’t need the military. ’Cause we would have a wall. So I’m going to be signing a national emergency, and it’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents, from 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There has rarely been a problem. They sign it. Nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. They sign it for far less important things in some cases, in many cases. We are talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We have some of the greatest people I know—they’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign, almost from the first week—the angel moms. Unfortunately, we have new angel moms. One incredible woman who showed me her daughter who we’re talking about, killed in the year of ’18. I said, “I haven’t seen you before.” She said, “No, I’m new.” I said, “That’s too bad, it’s too bad, it’s so sad.” Stand up just for a second. Show how beautiful your girl was. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I have such respect for these people. Angel moms, angel dads, angel families. I have great respect for these people. These are great people. These are great people. They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country. And the press doesn’t cover them. They don’t want to, incredibly, and they’re not treated the way they should be. They are fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody—we have one young lady whose husband—please, stand up. Your husband was just killed in Maryland. Incredible man just killed. Beautiful children won’t be seeing their father again. These are brave people. These are people that—they don’t have to be here. They don’t have to be doing this. They are doing it for other people. So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay, I really do. I want to thank you. Incredible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed at least—I think the number is ridiculously low—by drugs including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl. Now one of the things that I did with President Xi in China when I met him in Argentina at a summit before I started talking about the trade—it was a trade meeting, it went very well. But before I talked about trade I talked about something more important. I said, “Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country, kills tens of thousands of people, I think far more than anybody registers. And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.” And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list. Their criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our criminal list a drug dealer gets a thing called—how about a fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And when I asked President Xi, I said, “You have a drug problem?” [He said,] “No, no, no.” I said, “You have 1.4 billion people, what do you mean you have no drug problem?” [He said,] “No, we don’t have a drug problem.” I said, “Why?” [He said,] “Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.” End of problem. What do we do? We set up blue-ribbon committees, lovely men and women. They sit around the table. They have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time. So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem. You can end it a lot faster than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs. And it’s a criminal penalty and the penalty is death. So that’s frankly one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal. Want to know the truth, I think maybe there is no more important point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal. It’s going to be great with this country and great for China, I hope. Their market is down close to 40 percent. Our market is way up. We have picked up since my election trillions of dollars of worth, trillions, many trillions. And China has lost trillions of dollars. But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States. We’ll see what happens. China is coming here next week. They are coming home, the traders. And then China is coming here next week. I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe have remaining deals. We’ll make them directly one-on-one ourselves. So.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency and it’s a great thing to do. Because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people and it’s unacceptable. And by signing the national emergency, something signed many times by other presidents, many, many times—President Obama, in fact—we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed having to do with cartels, criminal cartels. It’s a very good emergency that he signed. And we’re going to use parts of it on our dealings on cartels. So that would be a second national emergency. But in that case it’s already in place. And what we really want to do is simple. It’s not like it is complicated. It’s very simple. We want to stop drugs from coming into our country. We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country. Nobody has done the job that we have ever done. I mean nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy—and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes, you know, I hear a lot of people say, “Oh well, but maybe the previous administration … ”—let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south and it was going fast. We would have been down the tubes. The regulations were strangling our country, unnecessary regulations. By creating such a strong economy, you just look at your televisions and see what is going on today, it’s through the roof. What happens is more people want to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we have ever had before and we have done an incredible job in stopping them, but it is a massive number of people. If we had the wall it would be very easy. We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people. We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row. You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent. We would get, we would get thousands of law-enforcement people including Border Patrol. You put them in different areas and you have them doing different things, law enforcement and Border Patrol. And I want to thank law enforcement and I want to thank Border Patrol and I want to thank ICE. ICE is abused by the press, and by the Democrats, by the way, we are going to be taking care of ICE. We talk about the new bill. We’re going to be taking care of ICE. They wanted to get rid of ICE. And the bill is just the opposite of that. A lot of good things happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So that’s the story. We want to have a safe country. I ran on a very simple slogan: Make America great again. If you are going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you are going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then—very hard to make America great again. But we have done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment. We haven’t been given the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff—ports of entry. We have so much money we don’t know what to do with it. I don’t know what to do with all the money they are giving us. It’s crazy. The only place they don’t want to give us much money—$1.375 billion, it sounds like a lot, but it is not so much, although we are putting it to much better use than it used to be. A lot of the past administrations, they had, it was easy to get, they didn’t build. They didn’t do what they could have done. It would have been great. It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job and a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half, people that should have stepped up did not step up. They didn’t step up and they should have, it would have been easy. Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier. But some people didn’t step up. But we are stepping up now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion; whether it is $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s gonna build a lot of wall. We’re getting it done. We are right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas, and we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall making it just as good as new. That’s where a lot of the money has been spent, on renovation. In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay. But we are going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon, so, and we need new wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank, in particular, the angel moms and dads for being here. Thank you very much. We have great respect for you. The real country, our real country, the people that really love our country, they love you. So I just want you to know that, I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do. Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly. And we are giving you a lot of surplus. We are giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving previous to this administration, but hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment. And as we get it, as you know, we send it down, and you have much better protection. But I really appreciate you being here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So the order is signed, and I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office, and we will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling and then we will get another bad ruling, and then we will end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we will get a fair shake and win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban—they sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court and we won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And it was very interesting because yesterday they were talking about the ban, because we have a ban that is very helpful, Madam Secretary, is that right? Without the ban, we would have a bigger problem. We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world, and we won. But somebody said, “President Trump lost on the ban.” He was right. I lost at the lower court. He didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court. They don’t want to say that, they didn’t want to go that far. They were saying how I lost, the person sitting right up here. “Donald Trump lost on the ban.” Yeah, I did, and then I lost a second time, and you should have said that, too. Then it went to the Supreme Court and I won. Didn’t want to take it that far. But we won on the ban and we won on other things too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we are declaring it for virtual invasion purposes—drugs, traffickers, and gangs. And one of the things, just to finish, we have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters, thousands. They are out of this country. We take them out by the thousands. And they are monsters. Okay.

The absences were telling: Foreign ministers from Germany and France &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20190213-us-hopes-increase-pressure-iran-mideast-summit-despite-european-resistance"&gt;declined to show&lt;/a&gt;, sending lower-level officials instead. The EU’s foreign-affairs chief had a scheduling conflict. Representatives for key players in the Middle East—including the Palestinian Authority, Iran, Russia, and Turkey—also &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trumps-diplomatic-dumpster-fire-on-iran-warsaw-conference-poland-mike-pompeo/"&gt;weren’t there&lt;/a&gt;. The last three were at a conference of their own, where they &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russia-turkey-and-iran-hold-syria-talks-with-an-eye-on-final-rebel-stronghold/2019/02/14/0fe14a36-2eca-11e9-8781-763619f12cb4_story.html?utm_term=.5dc67e4c7e24"&gt;lauded&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. withdrawal from Syria and said Syrian troops should replace the Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/02/germany-preps-plan-b-uncertain-america-foreign-policy/582715/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Germany preps a Plan B for Trump’s foreign-policy ‘zigzag’&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was after the formal Warsaw agenda was broadened from its Iran-centric origins to accommodate the Europeans, who broadly support the Iran nuclear deal and have tried to preserve it since the U.S. withdrawal. Even Pompeo’s co-host, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz, emphasized Europe’s commitment to the accord at a joint press conference with the U.S. secretary of state, though he did “condemn intolerable actions of Iran beyond its own territory, including Europe,” where the EU has &lt;a href="https://euobserver.com/foreign/143854"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Iran of directing four recent terrorist plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pompeo didn’t take the bait in that setting; he barely mentioned Iran at all. But the administration’s focus on Iran was clear in other venues—for instance, in Pompeo’s appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where he noted destabilizing Iranian activities throughout the region and remarked, “You can’t achieve peace and stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It’s just not possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President Pence went further in his own speech, criticizing European allies of the United States for their efforts to do business with Iran despite the reimposition of American nuclear-related sanctions on the regime. And he referred explicitly to the growing rift between America and its European allies, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-warsaw-ministerial-working-luncheon-warsaw-poland/"&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt; that such efforts “will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU, and create still more distance between Europe and America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see any real benefit to this,” said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution. “It doesn’t speak well of the administration’s organizational capacity that after a lot of high-profile attention to this conference, there wasn’t a lot of there there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the Iran issue divides traditional allies, it unites traditional adversaries. What were perhaps the summit’s most significant moments of unity came from improbable places, namely between the Israelis and the Arabs. Netanyahu noted as much in an unfortunately phrased tweet on Wednesday, where he &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-14/netanyahu-accidentally-tells-the-truth-about-war-with-iran"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; Israel and Arab countries’ “common interest of war with Iran”—before reissuing the tweet with a softer “combating Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/trump-syria-middle-east/558053/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A Trump doctrine for the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was something significantly short of Middle East peace, but still significant. It wasn’t the unveiling of Jared Kushner’s much-hyped peace plan; there was no photo op with Netanyahu and the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs. There was, however, Netanyahu attending a session with Arab officials and meeting with the Omani foreign minister; there was the Bahraini foreign minister’s &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/bahrain-fm-believes-ties-with-israel-will-be-normalized-eventually/"&gt;declaration&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Times of Israel&lt;/em&gt; that his country would “eventually” establish ties with Israel; there was even a former senior Saudi official giving an &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-prince-turki-to-israel-tv-netanyahu-deceiving-israel-about-peace-chances/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; to an Israeli television station, albeit one in which he criticized what he called Netanyahu’s “hubristic attitude.” The official, Prince Turki bin Faisal, who once served as the kingdom’s head of intelligence, also noted, “We don’t need Mr. Netanyahu to tell us the dangers Iran poses.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the rapprochement will go only so far, said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The Arab states are worried about Iran, he said, but Netanyahu’s “war” gaffe didn’t help anybody. The Arabs “do not need a war. That they don’t need, and they know it.” And there are serious limits on how much they’re willing to cooperate formally with Israel absent progress on the Palestinian issue, he said. Prince Turki said as much in his interview: “From the Israeli point of view, Mr. Netanyahu would like us to have a relationship, and then we can fix the Palestinian issue. From the Saudi point of view, it’s the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Warsaw confab produced little of immediate substance but a call for more dialogue and the establishment of working groups on a range of issues, including cybersecurity and missile proliferation. The very number of parties in attendance would naturally limit their ability to forge agreements, given the wide range of perspectives at stake. If Pompeo hoped to stitch together more support from the Europeans for the Trump administration’s Iran policy, he instead succeeded in highlighting their divisions. And still the size of the gathering—which also included representation from Asia and Latin America—said something about the convening power of the United States. And perhaps it provided an implicit warning that in the face of European snubs, the U.S. may try to find its backing elsewhere. Whether American sanctions against Iran can survive without the Europeans is another question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/YjUJ0fHJTW4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Gilsinan</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/kathy-gilsinan/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/AP_19045470116621/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Michael Sohn / AP</media:credit><media:description>Mike Pence, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pose for a photo at the Warsaw conference.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Trump Administration Can’t Get a United Front Against Iran</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/YjUJ0fHJTW4/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T12:52:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T16:04:08-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582877</id><summary type="html">But the Warsaw conference did bring together Gulf Arabs and Israel against their common enemy.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-administration-cant-get-united-front-against-iran/582877/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and the tech journalist Kara Swisher conducted a full 90-minute interview &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/12/18222178/kara-swisher-jack-dorsey-interview-twitter-transcript-karajack"&gt;entirely on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The interview was meant to be an old-school “Twitter chat,” and users were instructed to follow along using the hashtag #KaraJack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was a disaster. Attempting to follow a public conversation happening on Twitter is “pretty much a mess right now,” Dorsey himself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KurtWagner8/status/1096133753947078656"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; at a conference yesterday. The chat was so difficult to parse that &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; futilely attempted to collect Dorsey’s responses into a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Recode/status/1095451544676454406"&gt;Twitter Moment&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, other users begged the Thread Reader App bot to unroll the thread, to which it replied that it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1095457432757772288"&gt;simply could not&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Part of the problem is that #KaraJack didn’t follow any of the standard norms for Twitter chats (essentially long, back-and-forth conversations that unfurl in @ replies on the network). When I worked as a social-media strategist eight years ago, at the height of Twitter chats’ popularity, I conducted more than 100 of them for brands. They were almost all bad, but they were made marginally better by a couple of important protocols. One is to number the questions and replies so that it’s clear what exactly someone is replying to. Another is to space out questions and answers and not talk over each other. #KaraJack did neither. Both Swisher and Dorsey split the original thread and replied to the wrong tweets. Swisher &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kara-jack-twitter-interview/"&gt;made a typo right at the get-go&lt;/a&gt;. But still, following a conversation on Twitter shouldn’t be this hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The theoretical benefit of being on Twitter, a broadcast-based open social network, is to talk with other people and follow their conversations, even ones that don’t include you. Somehow, in 2019, the product has degraded to the point where this has become impossible. It’s like running through a public square shouting at people, trying to start a dialogue while getting jostled by a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The primary issue is threads. Threaded tweets were first &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/twitter-officially-launches-threads-a-new-feature-for-easily-writing-tweetstorms/"&gt;introduced back&lt;/a&gt; in December 2017 as an easier way for people to make “tweetstorms” cohesive. Twitter has done almost nothing to hone the feature since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/twitter-keeps-rolling-out-features-but-not-the-ones-that-matter/569296/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Twitter’s new features aren’t what users asked for&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious problem with threading is that it assumes Twitter users think linearly. In real life, you may post a 12-part thread only to realize that you need to expand on or clarify just the third tweet. If you reply to that third entry alone, you’ll break the thread, splitting it into two and making it harder for people to find the original. This not only makes complex thoughts difficult to communicate, but it also makes deciphering them almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The problems don’t stop there, though. The way Twitter shows replies is also confusing: Users have to click into each tweet in a thread to get the full scope of responses to it. There’s no simple, all-encompassing hub to view both the thread and the conversation happening around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The #KaraJack chat would have been a perfect opportunity for Twitter to show off a new hashtag hub or similar feature. The company has invested resources into &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/twitter-revealed-its-hashtag-triggered-emojis-for-lgtbq-pride-month/"&gt;adding emojis&lt;/a&gt; to the end of special hashtags, but it still hasn’t harnessed hashtags’ real power: collecting conversation. (Twitter declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When users click the #KaraJack hashtag, for instance, they should be presented with a chronological, easy-to-follow feed of Swisher and Dorsey’s conversation and the response tweets to it. Instead, Twitter offers a messy, algorithmic timeline full of random tweets, mostly from other people. Since both Swisher and Dorsey failed to include the #KaraJack tag in some of their tweets, those tweets are nowhere to be found. This is a missed opportunity: Twitter should have a way for users to hashtag an entire thread. Part of Swisher’s and Dorsey’s hashtag negligence could have been due to character-count pressures, since hashtags still inexplicably count toward the limit on each tweet. This makes users less likely to categorize their own content via hashtags; the company’s CEO just proved as much firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though Twitter prides itself on being an open social network, the #KaraJack interview proves its desperate need for more walled-off spaces. Currently Twitter offers users only two core privacy options: You can set your entire profile and tweets to public or private. But users who choose to remain private should have the ability to make their voices heard in public conversations. Twitter could offer privacy restrictions on individual units of content, as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and just about every other modern social platform do. Or it could allow users to keep a private profile while tweets with a public hashtag could be open to views, replies, and retweets from other users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter has another, bigger problem. No one will want to engage in any sort of public discussion on the platform until it recognizes the sheer depth of harassment taking place there. One big takeaway from the #KaraJack conversation was Dorsey’s failure to admit that harassment is an issue. When asked who he admired on Twitter, Dorsey championed Elon Musk, a man who regularly uses the platform to harass critics and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/musk-renews-pedophilia-claims-against-diver-in-thai-cave-rescue/"&gt;baselessly claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the man who saved Thai children trapped in a cave was a pedophile. If this denial continues, it will ultimately be the platform’s downfall. Most users don’t want to hop into a public discussion where simply tweeting with a female avatar can be enough to garner an inbox full of rape threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One way for Twitter to better moderate a user’s experience would be to create closed “rooms” for Twitter chats, where only approved people could participate. Facebook offers this feature through private groups; Reddit has subreddits, and Discord has rooms. This would help protect those who are participating in a thoughtful way from harassment, and could offer a less chaotic experience for those who are trying to follow along, by segmenting the chat out from their main feeds. It doesn’t matter how many &lt;a href="https://download.cnet.com/news/twitter-asks-users-to-test-colorful-status-updates-and-ice-breaker-tweets/"&gt;color-coded replies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1095784011845324801"&gt;pop-up profiles&lt;/a&gt; Twitter implements if chats are too hard to discover and follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whatever Twitter chooses to do, it must start making changes quickly. The company reported &lt;a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/7/18215204/twitter-daily-active-users-dau-snapchat-q4-earnings"&gt;just 126 million daily active users&lt;/a&gt; in its most recent earnings—fewer than Snapchat, which has been written off for its slowing growth. As Casey Newton at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/24/18195245/jack-dorsey-twitter-media-tour-2019"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; recently said, “There are talented product managers inside Twitter who would do more, if they could. But they are often stymied by internal roadblocks that—unlike the collective behavior of hundreds of millions of users—actually are under the CEO’s control.” Dorsey’s disastrous Twitter interview is proof that he needs to spend less time talking and more time focusing on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/x9UcI2XNEnM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTS2051K/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Reuters / Joshua Roberts</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">It’s Impossible to Follow a Conversation on Twitter</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/x9UcI2XNEnM/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T12:51:24-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T13:04:55-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582907</id><summary type="html">Without major fixes to the product, the platform will never be a place for complex discussions.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/its-impossible-follow-conversation-twitter/582907/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After failing for two years to persuade Congress to fund a wall on the southern border, President Donald Trump on Friday said he will declare a national emergency and reallocate some $8 billion to build the wall through executive fiat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump announced the move in a rambling, free-associative appearance in the White House Rose Garden that was more MAGA rally than presidential announcement. Even by the standards of this president, his remarks were confusing, untruthful, and often off topic, with strange ad-hominem attacks on other politicians and sharp exchanges with reporters. Despite claiming that the nation faces an acute crisis that requires immediate attention, the president meandered through a long preamble about trade deals and North Korea. When he finally got to the point, he struggled to stay focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to be signing today and registering national emergency,” he said. “And it’s a great thing to do, because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable. And by signing the national emergency, something signed many times by other presidents, many, many times, President Obama, in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed having to do with cartels, criminal cartels. It’s a very good emergency that he signed … And what we really want to do is simple. It’s not like it is complicated. It’s very simple. We want to stop drugs from coming into our country. We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country. Nobody has done the job that we have ever done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Trump also undermined his own case for the national emergency, effectively saying the declaration was all about political expediency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. I would rather do it much faster,” the president said, an astonishing acknowledgment that could come back to haunt him in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What the president could do if he declares a national emergency&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the least coherent appearances Trump has made in a presidency noted for its incoherence. Yet the circus in the Rose Garden threatened to distract from a major policy announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a briefing Friday morning, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that Trump would take $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from a Defense Department counter-drug fund, and another $3.6 billion from Pentagon military-construction money. Only the construction funds require an emergency declaration. Trump will not take money from disaster-relief funds, an idea that had been discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is sure to draw legal challenges, and might not take effect exactly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as Trump described. But the fact remains that the president has declared a national emergency in order to save face with anti-immigration members of the conservative media and his base, having been roundly defeated in a joust with Congress over funding. In essence, the president has created a new crisis to get himself out of a previous crisis—which he also created. And the timing of Trump’s announcement, after months of equivocating and congressional debate, hardly supports the idea of an acute crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an irony to Trump’s declaration. Prior to being elected, Trump aggressively criticized then-President Barack Obama, saying that he could be impeached for using executive orders to change immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now he has to use executive action and this is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overwritten easily by the Supreme Court,” Trump said in 2014.  The following year, Trump said, “The whole concept of executive order—it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run. He’s supposed to go through Congress and make a deal and go and talk to people and get the guys in there and, you know, whether you’re Republican or Democrat, is supposed to all get together. He’s supposed to make a deal, but he couldn’t make a deal, because it’s not his thing.” During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to withdraw Obama’s executive orders and accused him of abuses. Since becoming president, however, Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/13/politics/donald-trump-executive-orders/index.html"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; a prolific user of executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet by declaring a national emergency, Trump is doing something more aggressive still. There is nuance to the situation: As the White House points out, Trump is using powers granted to him under a law passed by Congress in 1976, and not creating powers out of thin air. But it’s not clear that this situation fits within the letter of the law, and it’s all but impossible to say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that it follows the spirit of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any declaration of emergency seems by definition distressing—either the president is announcing a bona fide emergency or the government is creating an opportunity for abuse of power, or both. The very point of emergency provisions is to circumvent standard protections and procedures. While that should be concerning to citizens in any case, it’s especially worthy of scrutiny coming from Trump, a president who has disregarded restraints, procedures, and laws even without claiming extraordinary powers; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/trump-leader-republican-party-or-president/574087/?utm_source=feed"&gt;acted like the ruler of a one-party state&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/trump-macron-erdogan/525783/?utm_source=feed"&gt;expressed admiration for authoritarians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Elizabeth Goitein &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;explained in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;, the 1976 National Emergencies Act superseded a range of laws that were designed to grant the president leeway to respond to an acute crisis. Congress concluded that there are times when the country needs to respond faster than the standard legislative process can act. Mulvaney said Friday that Trump is simply invoking this law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It actually creates zero precedent,” he said. “This is authority given to the president, given to the law already. It’s not like he didn’t get what he wants, so he’s waving his wand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only half true. The authority does exist, and critics saying otherwise are exaggerating. But it’s also &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like he didn’t get what he wanted, so he’s waving a wand. There’s a legitimate argument to be had over whether a serious problem exists at the border, though the case that there is one is weak. While &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/illegal-immigrant-arrests-deportations-rise.html"&gt;illegal immigration to the United States is rising&lt;/a&gt;, it remains well below the recent peak, in 2000. Trump allies have argued that recent incidents where the Border Patrol fired tear gas across the border show the menace posed by immigrants; however, as Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed out, &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/28/sarah-huckabee-sanders/sarah-sanders-says-obama-tear-gas-border-month/"&gt;tear-gassing was common&lt;/a&gt; during the Obama administration. The White House has also offered up a bogus statistic about terrorists trying to enter the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s no case to be made that Congress hasn’t had a chance to act. Trump has been asking lawmakers to fund his wall since he took office, in January 2017. He failed to persuade even a unified Republican Congress to give him the money. (On Friday morning, Trump repeatedly criticized those in the last Congress who didn’t push hard enough to fund the wall, a clear reference to former House Speaker Paul Ryan.) Since December, two Congresses—one with unified GOP control, and then another with a Democratic House and Republican Senate—have been extensively considering border funding, and they have decided, clearly, not to give Trump the money. The Constitution grants Congress the power to appropriate, and it has decided at length what it wants—a fact Mulvaney acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re simply incapable of providing the amount of money necessary in the president’s eyes to address the present situation at the border,” he said. But it’s impossible to believe that Congress passed the National Emergencies Act for the purpose of the president sidestepping the Constitution simply because Congress decided it disagreed with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fact other Republicans have acknowledged. Senator Susan Collins of Maine has called&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the emergency “dubious from a constitutional perspective.” Senator John Cornyn of Texas has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-privately-cautioned-trump-about-emergency-declaration-on-border-wall/2019/02/01/5ff1262c-2646-11e9-81fd-b7b05d5bed90_story.html?utm_term=.030212f63bb1"&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; worry that a future Democratic president could use unilateral power in ways that would make Republicans uncomfortable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said in the past that he hoped Trump would not declare an emergency. Yet on Thursday, McConnell announced he would support the declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the president does not need Congress’s say-so to declare an emergency, Congress does have the right to override him after the fact, with a vote of both houses. The House will likely do so, but it’s unclear whether enough Republicans in the Senate would join with Democrats to pass a measure there as well. In any case, Josh Dawsey of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1096403725697142790"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump would veto such a resolution—which would be the first veto of his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trumps-emergency-declaration-is-a-test-for-republicans/582856/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump’s emergency declaration is a test Republicans didn’t want to take&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump predicted in the Rose Garden that he would triumph in litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office,” he said, in a peculiar singsongy voice. “And we will have a national emergency. And we will then be sued and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit even though it shouldn’t be there. And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we will get another bad ruling, and then we will end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we will get a fair shake and win in the Supreme Court, just like the [travel] ban.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, even though Trump’s lengthy vacillation on whether to declare an emergency shows that the crisis is not as acute as he claims, it’s also helped inure the public to the declaration. But the declaration is still another huge violation of existing norms and constitutional protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The president appears single-mindedly focused on the wall, an unusually sustained focus for him. Given the concrete goal involved, this is probably not a situation in which Trump is likely to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;use the emergency as an excuse to take &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;other, more extraordinary actions&lt;/a&gt;, such as declaring martial law or ordering military action. Moreover, Trump’s biggest projects have been repeatedly bedeviled by failures of execution and follow-through, though even a limited impact in this case could be substantial. The point is that he could do those things. That’s a dangerous tool in the hands of a scrupulous president with great respect for restraints on his power—much less Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/P8Ss77SDSbU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>David A.

No, not the “crisis” at the border—if the word still has any universally accepted definition, there is no crisis at the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration/fy-2018"&gt;2018’s apprehensions&lt;/a&gt; along the southwestern border were the fifth lowest in nearly half a century. Last year’s records show modest growth from 2017, when apprehensions were lower than at any point since 1972. The administration notes an increase in the number of family units and unaccompanied minors crossing the border from Guatemala and Honduras. But the number of border-crossing families and children originating from Mexico and El Salvador has declined precipitously since 2016, and more juveniles crossed the border into the hands of patrol agents under &lt;a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/border-patrol-agents-dealt-more-children-under-pres-bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. His administration coped with that influx despite having fewer available resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Donald Trump, the crisis isn’t humanitarian but political. It is a crisis of confidence. He staked his reputation on constructing a wall along the southern border, and he’s not going to get one. Republicans in Congress had two years to appropriate the $25 billion Trump initially sought for a contiguous partition along the border, and they &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-shutdown-gamble-now-hinges-wall-many-republicans-never-ncna958426"&gt;passed on it at every available opportunity&lt;/a&gt;. Trump transformed the 2018 midterm elections into a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/415042-trumps-closing-argument-frames-midterms-as-a-referendum-on-his-white"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that a humanitarian disaster was unfolding at the border and the wall was the only answer. Voters were not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-emergency-declaration/582904/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump’s bizarre, rambling announcement of a national emergency&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having lost face at the polls, Trump sought to demonstrate who’s still the boss by demanding tribute from ascendant Democrats—a mere $5.7 billion, not for a wall per se, but for “steel slats” along a few miles of the border. He didn’t get it. Indeed, Trump will sign a compromise today that appropriates only $1.375 billion for fencing and border-security enhancements—less than what the GOP-led Congress was prepared to allocate at the end of 2018. That compromise bill also imposes a 17 percent reduction on the number of beds available in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, which would be an irresponsible thing for the president to sign amid a genuine immigration crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid this unambiguous series of defeats, Trump resolved to get his border-wall funding by other means: He said in a rambling press conference today that he would invoke the National Emergencies Act, under which he plans to circumvent Congress and reallocate approximately $8 billion apportioned to the Treasury and Defense Departments to construct his barrier along the border with Mexico. This is a staggeringly cynical maneuver not because it will finally hand Trump the MacGuffin on which he campaigned in 2016, but because it most likely won’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal observers expect the courts to impose an injunction on this national-emergency declaration as soon as it is made. Indeed, the president made the judiciary’s work easier on Friday when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1096445850002305024"&gt;he admitted&lt;/a&gt; that he “didn’t need to do this,” a confession that there is, in fact, no ongoing national emergency. A judicial quagmire is the GOP’s fondest hope. That way, Trump can say he’s fighting for his wall in every possible way, and Republicans in Congress can cede their authority to check the executive branch by insisting that the whole matter is out of their hands. And all without ever having to expropriate private property along the border or prove the dubious efficacy of a physical wall. Everybody wins!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-state-of-emergency/582913/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum: A state of unreality&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an especially dangerous game, in part because it further degrades the Madisonian scheme in which each branch of government is supposed to be a jealous steward of its constitutional prerogatives. Articles I and II seem especially eager to surrender their authority to Article III, if only to evade responsibility for having to execute their responsibilities. Trump’s game is dangerous, too, because it is contemptuous of Congress’s verdict on this domestic policy dispute. The president will radically expand the definition of what constitutes an emergency, the relevant statutes of which are supposed to be applied only when Congress cannot be consulted on the matter in a timely fashion. By appealing to the military to resolve a domestic policy dispute, Trump is actively eroding America’s sense of civic propriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the president has appealed to emergency powers reserved for periods of extraordinary duress, simply to achieve a petty political objective. When he imposed tariffs on heavy-metal imports from America’s trade partners, Trump invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-War/Trump-s-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-take-effect"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;. That provision is explicitly reserved for a national emergency, such as a natural disaster or war. But Trump promised his constituents in the manufacturing sector that he would protect their jobs, and so he had to label America’s trading partners—including allies like Japan—as threats to American national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump’s trade war heated up and its negative effects were being disproportionately absorbed by American farmers and ranchers, another core constituency, the president &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/24/trump-trade-aid-for-farmers-737108"&gt;appealed to national security again&lt;/a&gt; to ease their pain. His administration offered aid to affected sectors of the agricultural industry to the tune of $12 billion by citing the Agriculture Department’s broad authority to stabilize that sector of the economy during times of tumult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What the president could do if he declares a state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he eventually abandoned the move, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-planning-unprecedented-intervention-in-electricity-markets-076cbfb3-2ecf-4d04-a4cf-abeb22321ff5.html"&gt;planned to invoke&lt;/a&gt; Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to force American energy markets to purchase electricity from inefficient coal and nuclear plants at above-market rates. This provision is exclusively reserved for American presidents amid a national cataclysm that renders Congress inaccessible, but the Trump administration sought to use it only to provide this favored constituency with a federal bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Trump’s decision to invoke national security to erect his wall is stopped indefinitely by the courts, we may look back upon this moment as the crossing of the Rubicon. Congressional Democrats aren’t even being coy about their desire to expand on this precedent when their party regains control of the White House. “Want to talk about a national emergency?” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeDelMoro/status/1096147713039745025"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “The epidemic of gun violence in America. That’s a national emergency.” There is no shortage of Democrats who are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1096143670401744897"&gt;similarly convinced&lt;/a&gt; that climate change also represents an existential crisis, to say nothing of a national emergency. Many have endorsed &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2019/02/08/heres-the-full-text-of-congress-green-new-deal-resolution-introduced-by-rep-alexandra-ocasio-cortez/"&gt;draconian anti-industrial policies&lt;/a&gt; that are unlikely to pass in Congress as the only rational remedy to the crisis. The next president will undoubtedly face pressure from his or her core constituents to apply the precedent Trump is setting to their domestic policy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most pernicious effect of the president’s extraordinary maneuver here is how he will drag complacent Republicans along with him into the abyss. Once invoked, &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1622"&gt;50 U.S. Code § 1622&lt;/a&gt; on national emergencies sets into motion a series of events, including an almost immediate vote by the House of Representatives ratifying the president’s decision. The House will certainly reject Trump’s national-emergency declaration, sending that motion to the Senate, where it cannot be tabled. And that GOP-controlled chamber will be compelled to support Trump’s transparently political debasing of constitutional norms, not because of support for Trump, but because of pressure from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the revelation that Trump would use extraordinary powers to build his wall, Republicans in the Senate &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/gop-national-emergency-declaration-trump-1170697"&gt;went on record&lt;/a&gt; opposing the move. “I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” said Senator Chuck Grassley. “I’m not really for it,” Senator Rand Paul agreed. This was a “dramatic expression” of emergency powers, a “bad idea,” and entirely “unnecessary,” said Senators Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio, and Lamar Alexander, respectively. “I think it’s a dangerous step,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/government-shutdown-vote-border-bill-trump-n971576"&gt;averred&lt;/a&gt; Senator John Cornyn. “It undermines the role of Congress and the appropriations process,” Senator Susan Collins agreed. But this apprehension is apparently not shared by McConnell, who has proved an effective shepherd of his conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s not mince words: Backing Trump in this moment is not the prerogative of an institutionalist, which the majority leader claims to be. It is the prerogative of a partisan operator motivated, above all, by deference to a fleeting political imperative: avoiding another government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a moment of extreme national cowardice. America’s governing institutions are abdicating their authority in pursuit of expedience and amid a craven scramble to save face. A precedent has been established that all Americans, but conservative Americans in particular, will long regret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/HOmu_SwtEAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Noah Rothman</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/noah-rothman/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX6MWVB/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jim Young / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Conservatives Will Live to Regret This</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/HOmu_SwtEAY/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T12:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T14:32:53-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582934</id><summary type="html">With his national-emergency declaration, Trump has crossed the Rubicon.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-national-security-threat/582934/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 10 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States. Their fate is among the most polarizing, seemingly intractable issues in American politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of a substantial amnesty often make humanitarian arguments, highlighting the most affecting challenges faced by families “living in the shadows.” That makes it easy to conclude that the debate is best understood as pitting globalists who emphasize the needs of the least well-off against nationalists who insist that the nation must prioritize what’s best for its own citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fault line certainly runs through the immigration debate. But it can be misleading. Imagine that the welfare of undocumented immigrants counts for nothing at all—that their fate should turn entirely on what makes U.S. citizens best off. Given that constraint, there’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a strong case that an amnesty is the best policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many on both sides of the debate intuit otherwise because they conceive of undocumented immigrants as laborers who crowd into segregated urban enclaves, follow harvests, or sleep in worker bunks at meatpacking plants. In this telling, they might interact with Americans when making up our motel rooms or bussing our tables, but were they deported, the worst consequences most of “us” might suffer would be higher prices for lettuce or lawn maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are wealthy Americans who interact with undocumented immigrants almost entirely as consumers of cheap labor; there are working-class Americans who interact with undocumented immigrants mostly as competitors for jobs; and those incentives do, in fact, fuel self-interested positions on the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But so many undocumented immigrants have been in the United States for so long that literally millions are deeply integrated into American communities. They have friends, classmates, neighbors, and co-workers who are U.S. citizens. Many of them have enjoyed significant economic success too. All of that helps explain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-83-percent-support-pathway-to-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; such as the one Fox News did in 2017, which noted that setting up “a system to legalize undocumented immigrants working in the U.S. receives bipartisan support: most Democrats (95 percent legalize vs. 4 percent deport), Republicans (69–28 percent) and independents (82–13 percent) want legalization to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Pew found that “a solid majority (72%) of Americans—including 80% of Democrats, 76% of independents and 56% of Republicans—say undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. &lt;a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/06/04/broad-public-support-for-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/"&gt;should be allowed to stay&lt;/a&gt; in this country legally if they meet certain requirements.” Most recently, a 2019 Gallup Poll &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246455/solid-majority-opposes-new-construction-border-wall.aspx"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 81 percent “favor allowing immigrants living illegally in the U.S. the chance to become citizens if they meet certain requirements over a period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching Lou Dobbs or listening to Rush Limbaugh, one could be forgiven for concluding that support for a substantial amnesty is a radical position that cosmopolitan elites want to foist on “regular Americans.” In fact, despite being a legislative improbability at the moment, amnesty is very popular in this country. It is opponents of amnesty who are out of step with “regular Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That majorities of Americans favor a qualified amnesty is strong evidence for the proposition that it is the policy that would make citizens best off. Even those motivated by selfless humanitarian concerns derive value from getting their way in politics. But it is not definitive evidence, in part because it doesn’t tell us much about salience. Maybe lots of people favor amnesty but don’t care about it that much, while a smaller number oppose it with a strong, passionate hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that among the minority of American citizens who oppose granting legal status to most undocumented immigrants, a sizable faction counts the issue as among the most important, or close to it, and opposes any amnesty intensely. Are any of their fellow citizens similarly passionate in the other direction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, in fact, millions of American citizens who very likely value amnesty &lt;em&gt;much more&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;highly &lt;/em&gt;than the vast majority of its most passionate opponents value stopping it. Pew Research &lt;a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/a-portrait-of-unauthorized-immigrants-in-the-united-states/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 that “the number of U.S.-born children in mixed-status families (unauthorized immigrant parents and citizen children) has expanded rapidly in recent years, to 4 million in 2008 from 2.7 million in 2003.” That number is almost certainly even higher than 4 million today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we’re trying to maximize the happiness of Americans, with no regard for morality, just utility, how should we compare the cost suffered by a restrictionist who doesn’t get his way on amnesty in relation to the benefit derived by another American citizen for whom amnesty means &lt;em&gt;getting to live in the same country&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;as their mother and father&lt;/em&gt; without worrying about their deportation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re admittedly crossing into the realm of speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there is a hugely compelling case for the proposition that 4 million Americans who will no longer worry that armed agents of the state will force their moms and dads to move far away, often to an impoverished or dangerous country, will get more utility from an amnesty than millions of those most opposed will lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When one starts to treat all Americans with close personal connections to undocumented immigrants as fully equal citizens whose pursuit of happiness is as valuable as that of any others, rather than unconsciously discounting them as possessing less legitimate claims to the nation, the case for legalizing the status of their parents or romantic partners or best friends or employers or employees starts to add up to a whole lot of profound benefits for Americans. And that’s leaving aside public goods that would flow from amnesty, such as hastening assimilation and facilitating better cooperation with local authorities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike some proponents of amnesty, I do not discount the preferences of the people on the other side of the debate, who object to rewarding unlawful entry or feel deep psychological discomfort with difference and ethnocultural change. Those concerns are legitimate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don’t think it’s fair for their fears and strong predisposition to prize sameness to trump a policy that has majority support and that would very likely enhance the overall happiness and well-being of Americans. That’s especially so because undocumented immigrants who’ve been here for many years likely play a lesser role in the activation of latent predispositions to authoritarianism than does the rapid introduction of refugee populations or the overall changes in ethnocultural makeup that flow from ongoing legal immigration. Legalizing undocumented immigrants doesn’t change who resides here; they’re already here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compromise bill that traded a substantial amnesty for a five-year pause in legal immigration; the aggressive, ongoing deportation of newcomers who are convicted of felonies; offering permanent legal status rather than eventual citizenship for older unlawful entrants; and a shift away from chain migration toward a skills-based system might even be a satisfactory bargain both for Americans who are appalled at the treatment of undocumented immigrants &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; for fearful authoritarians. Loath as I’d be to delay the legal migration of newcomers eager to come here for a better life, I’d likely support such a compromise as an elected official faced with the alternative of extending a decades-long nightmare for the undocumented and the tens of millions of Americans who love them. Or if Donald Trump wants to trade an amnesty for a wall, that’s worth it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a substantial amnesty should no longer be conceived of as a radical, unpopular proposal that starry-eyed humanitarians must wrest as a concession from the majority. Amnesty is a sensible policy with majoritarian popular support that can be justified on the nationalistic basis of increasing the overall happiness of Americans. Its supporters should push for its stand-alone passage. And opponents of amnesty should be forced to recognize that the longer they delay in agreeing to a bargain that legalizes the status of undocumented immigrants, the weaker &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; ability to wrest any concessions will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/pdeJFk3fpU8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Conor Friedersdorf</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/conor-friedersdorf/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX4X52G/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Shannon Stapleton / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Nationalist Case for Amnesty</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/pdeJFk3fpU8/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T12:08:57-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T14:08:49-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582688</id><summary type="html">It wouldn’t just benefit undocumented immigrants—it would benefit millions of American citizens.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/immigration-amnesty/582688/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A piñata hangs from a tree in Diversity Plaza in Jackson Heights, Queens. It is decorated with the face of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and by the end of Thursday night it will meet the fate of all piñatas. It is here to celebrate a major victory for grassroots activism in New York City. Earlier in the day, Amazon announced that it would not build its planned headquarters in Queens, with or without $3 billion in tax incentives. After months of intense opposition from a coalition of dedicated progressive groups and local politicians, the tech giant has folded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the best Valentine’s Day present ever,” says one woman in the crowd. Volunteers hand out chocolate kisses. It is February 14 and you can feel the love. Activists fall into one another’s arms, bestowing congratulations. Many are women. Most are young people of color. The faces here tonight contradict the media’s claim that the Amazon opposition is mostly made up of white, upper-class NIMBYs. As the crowd grows in number, Fahd Ahmed, an immigrant from Pakistan and a grassroots organizer, starts off the speeches. “We just beat the richest man in the world,” he shouts. The crowd cheers. They are jubilant and they should be. Together they helped bring down a Goliath that few imagined would fall. As Ahmed says, “It is a turning of the tide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, the tide in New York City has moved in one direction—rising to lift the fortunes and freedoms of the rich while ushering in hyper-gentrification and displacement for the working class. Leveraging the fiscal crisis of the time, New York’s leaders abruptly turned away from the city’s burgeoning social democracy toward the radical capitalist ideology of neoliberalism, a model of governance that focuses on privatization, deregulation, fiscal austerity, small government, and trickle-down economics. New York was reorganized into a competitive city, fighting a Darwinian battle with other cities around the globe for world-class businesses, mega-developments, and tourist dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strategy required giving large tax breaks and other incentives to big businesses and real-estate developers, especially those that promised something shiny in return. One of the first and biggest recipients of New York’s corporate-welfare program was Donald Trump, the ultimate developer of glitz in the greed-is-good, over-the-top era of the 1980s. Without the multimillion-dollar giveaways he reaped for the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Trump Tower, would he have built his fortune and celebrity to such powerful heights? It is perhaps cosmic justice that four decades later the movement to turn back the neoliberal model is fueled by righteous anger unleashed by Trump’s election to the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Diversity Plaza, the speeches end with a chant of “We are the revolution!” and people are leaping with fists in the air. A mariachi band begins to play. A man blows bubbles overhead and people dance on the snow-wet pavement. The defeat of Amazon has ignited a sense of possibility, and it seems as if everyone is talking about a major shift in the collective consciousness of the city. Under a lamppost, in the phosphorescent glow of a Bangladeshi buffet, I talk with Ahmed. As the executive director of Desis Rising Up and Moving, he helped organize tonight’s event. “This is a loss for the neoliberal approach to the city’s physical and economic development,” he tells me. “Politicians have felt the change in the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s quite right that local politicians are starting to respond to the people’s demands. At a city-council hearing in January, Speaker Corey Johnson slammed Amazon executives while protesters held a banner that read &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Amazon delivers lies&lt;/span&gt;. State Senator Michael Gianaris, recently appointed to the Public Authorities Control Board, pushed back against Governor Andrew Cuomo and demanded an end to the Amazon deal. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was an early opponent of the plan. When news broke of Thursday’s decision, she tweeted, “Anything is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cities where unfettered global capitalism and hyper-gentrification have taken hold, making neighborhoods unlivable for all but the wealthy, activists might start looking to the anti-Amazon fight for strategies. Lena Afridi, the director of economic policy at the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development and an immigrant born in Karachi and raised in Queens, sees this broad coalition, led by women, people of color, and immigrants, as a model for progressives everywhere. “This will have an international impact,” she tells me. “People all over the world are watching Queens. And it’s beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over warm cups of butter tea at a nearby Tibetan restaurant, the anti-gentrification activists Beatriz Rodriguez of #SaveNYC and Kirsten Theodos of TakeBackNYC agree that there is something powerful about Queens that Amazon did not anticipate. The borough holds the Guinness World Record for “most ethnically diverse urban area on the planet,” and with diversity comes healthy dissent and resistance. “The people here really struggle,” Rodriguez says. “They are being displaced all the time. They left other countries to come here and get pushed around again? That’s why they have that fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like a lot of Manhattan,” Kirsten adds, “which is so whitewashed. For the people in Queens, it’s about survival.” And where there is a fight for survival, there cannot be complacency. There must be progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress, in this case, means looking to the past. Many New Yorkers now believe the party line that to have a functional city, you have to welcome big development, and to have jobs, you have to give away billions in taxpayer money to corporations. But not too long ago, New York was a rambunctious and progressive city. Its unbridled spirit, what came to be known as “New York values,” was built by a confluence of immigrants, people of color, artists, early LGBTQ communities, and a strong working class. They brought democratic socialism, built strong unions, and fought for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Stein, an urban-studies instructor at Hunter College and the author of &lt;em&gt;Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State, &lt;/em&gt;also sees the Amazon defeat as a watershed moment—and he expects pushback from the establishment. “Some will say that the successful fight against Amazon’s HQ2 marks the death of New York and the triumph of negativity and fear over progress and development,” he says. “They will say it shows that we can’t do big things anymore. I say: Bullshit. This is not the death of New York City; this is its resuscitation. If it is the end of anything, it is the end of an era in which people feared the developers, and the beginning of a time in which developers fear the people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those developers were here at Diversity Plaza, they might at least feel nervous. Boodoosingh, a Tassa drumming group, is pounding out a percussive rhythm so powerful you can feel it in the marrow of your bones. Its ancestral beat, calling back to Trinidad and Tobago, to colonized India and ancient Persia, intensifies and rises until it feels like an exorcism, a ritual cleansing. The people in the crowd are moving together, bouncing on their toes, dancing with arms in the air. A spirit is reverberating through the people and it will not stop. Behind the drummers, the head of Jeff Bezos looks on from the piñata. After the music, Ahmed announces, “This is our city. A new New York is rising.” Someone hands a broomstick to a boy in the crowd and points him toward the piñata. The people gather close, urging the boy to hit it hard. He aims and takes a whack. Then another. Bezos’s head spins. The boy keeps at it. Another whack and the piñata splits open, spilling out a glittering burst of confetti. The crowd cheers and the dancing continues into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/lQNJE_nfdO8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremiah Moss</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/jeremiah-moss/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX6LUYG/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Nandita Bose / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Graffiti opposing the construction of the new Amazon campus covers a fence in Long Island City, Queens.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">A Dispatch From the Anti-Amazon Victory Party</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/lQNJE_nfdO8/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T11:59:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T14:59:26-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582922</id><summary type="html">Could this be the end of the neoliberal hold on New York City?</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/progressive-groups-queens-celebrate-amazons-exit/582922/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s declaration of emergency salved yesterday’s loss of face—but has not solved any real problems for this administration or the country. In fact, Trump has opened four new problems atop the original problem with which he has flailed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The original problem is that a border wall was Trump’s signature promise, backed by his guarantee—“Believe me!”—that Mexico would pay for it. Trump has successfully induced his supporters to shrug off the abandonment of his promise that “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFH2W-cScu0&amp;amp;t=1282"&gt;Mexico will pay for the wall&lt;/a&gt;,” which is an impressive hustle already. He might well have induced them to forget the wall, or to accept that a light upgrade of the existing 700 miles of fencing counted as “the wall.” By now, his supporters are much more invested in the idea of Trump as a success than in his achieving any success in particular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Still, Trump has to imagine that in 2020 some political opponent will drive to an unfenced part of the U.S.-Mexico border with a camera crew, walk back and forth across it, and make a mocking campaign commercial asking: &lt;em&gt;Whatever happened to the wall?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that was Trump’s foundational trouble, the threat that demanded a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/trump-emergency-declaration/582904/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump’s bizarre, rambling announcement of a national emergency&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He felt the need to be seen doing something, at least. The state of emergency is that something. But this something comes with four catches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first catch is legal. The declaration of a state of emergency is heading almost immediately to court. Construction could be enjoined while the litigation proceeds. Trump could lose. Yes, that would give him somebody to blame in 2020. &lt;em&gt;Liberal judges stopped the wall. &lt;/em&gt;But a loss with an excuse remains a loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By declaring an emergency, the president gains legal authority to move around some military-construction funds, reportedly about $3.6 billion. But that money has to come from somewhere, and where it comes from is other projects. “That must have been really tough. To lose. To be a loser.” Those were Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/andrew-mccabe-fbi-book-excerpt-the-threat/582748/?utm_source=feed"&gt;mocking words&lt;/a&gt; to Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, as quoted in his new book. He’ll have to wear them himself if the courts stop his wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The legal route imposes another risk. Few voters will understand the limits on the emergency powers Trump has just invoked. The invocation will sound to many like final confirmation that Trump aspires to dictatorship. If the courts stop him, he will look like a defeated dictator—dangerous but weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What the president could do if he declares a state of emergency&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second catch is legislative. Congress will now vote on a statement of disapproval of Trump’s use of his emergency authority. That statement will fly through the House of Representatives. In the Senate, it will need only 51 votes. Can Trump muster a blocking majority? Maybe not. He can veto the bill, and Congress might not muster the two-thirds majority necessary to override it. But even if he does, Congress will have gone on record accusing the president of abusing his powers, and acting like a dictator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Central American border crossing and asylum claiming have been accelerating since the end of 2017. What kind of emergency can be postponed for 14 months? In 2018, Congress offered a lot of money for more fencing. Trump refused it. Even in 2019, it offered some. The state of emergency allows the president to reach for a little more than offered in 2019, but a lot less than was on the table in 2018. This does not look like emergency behavior. A congressional vote of disapproval will harden the already widespread impression that Trump himself does not believe his own claims, that he is playing demagogic politics with border security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The third catch is political. The emergency powers Trump has proclaimed allow him to reshuffle money between military-construction envelopes. Every additional dollar he devotes to the border is a dollar taken from another project already approved by Congress. Every one of those projects has patrons and sponsors. And because most military contracting goes to red states, most of the reshuffled dollars will be removed from red states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the projects at risk: a $32 million vehicle-maintenance shop in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. I have no idea whether this project is supremely necessary or a pork-barrel boondoggle. But I bet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell strongly believes it is the former. What will Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina—up for reelection in 2020—think if Trump pulls funds from the approved but not yet contracted project for a new aircraft hangar at the Marine Corps’ air station in his state? And so on down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-national-security-threat/582934/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Noah Rothman: Conservatives will live to regret this&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Republicans have submitted to a lot since 2017. Trump might at last have discovered their breaking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The fourth catch is constitutional. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has pointed out that Democrats stand ready and eager to make use of the emergency-powers precedent being created here if they reclaim the White House in 2020. Yet once the courts get done, Trump’s precedent might actually set new &lt;i&gt;limits &lt;/i&gt;on presidential emergency powers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember, the most binding Supreme Court ruling on emergency powers delivered a rebuke to presidential power: the 1952 steel-seizure case &lt;em&gt;Youngstown Sheet &amp;amp; Tube Company v. Sawyer. &lt;/em&gt;In the context of a real emergency, the Korean War, President Harry Truman tested the outer limits of his power to seize private property—and got told no. The case governs to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s assertion of emergency powers does not go anywhere so far as Truman’s. He’s messing with congressional prerogatives, not private property—but he’s inviting another sharp rebuke, one that will bind future presidents, too. Those future presidents might someday want for an authentic public purpose the powers Trump will shortly squander for crass political motives. To rebuke Trump’s abuses, the better presidents of tomorrow will be denied a power they might have used for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trump has been hoisted high by his vision of the presidency as the world’s highest-rated reality-TV drama. His instinct to escape every previous episode’s failure by creating a new drama for the next episode has served him well to date. But reality TV is ultimately not reality. Government is very real, and hedged by realities. Reality is now exacting its retribution upon the Trump presidency. Ahead looms the fate that the reality-TV star must most dread: the cancellation of the whole crazy series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/YGm9zAJpbbk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>David Frum</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-frum/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/RTX6MBT0/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Leah Millis / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">A State of Unreality</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/YGm9zAJpbbk/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T10:48:55-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T16:47:34-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582913</id><summary type="html">Trump’s emergency declaration is going to run into four hurdles.</summary><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/trump-state-of-emergency/582913/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every week, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/friendship-files/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The Friendship Files&lt;/a&gt; features a conversation between &lt;/em&gt;The Atlantic’s &lt;em&gt; Julie Beck and two or more friends, exploring the history and significance of their relationship. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week she talks with two former contestants on the U.K. reality show &lt;em&gt;The Great British Bake Off &lt;/em&gt;(known in the U.S. as &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show&lt;/em&gt;) who forged an intergenerational friendship during the competition. They discuss the shared love of motorcycles that brought them together, the games they played during downtime on set, and how they stay close with each other as well as all the other bakers from their season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Friends: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Selasi Gbormittah, 33&lt;/span&gt;, a banker who lives in London&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Val Stones, 68&lt;/span&gt;, a (semi) retired teacher who lives in Somerset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you first meet? Was it when filming started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi Gbormittah&lt;/strong&gt;:  We met in January 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val Stones&lt;/strong&gt;: We happened to be on the same technical challenge, didn't we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. For &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt; auditions, it's usually done in groups. I think it was on my final technical interview. I was hungover; it was my 30th birthday and I was in Prague. I caught an early flight and came back to the U.K., and had to bake my challenges to take with me. And that's where I met Val for the first time. Actually, Val and Kate [Barmby, another contestant].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="475" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Bakeoff4/6bd3835a5.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Selasi Gbormittah (bottom) and Val Stones (second from right) pose with the other contestants on the set of &lt;em&gt;The Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;. Courtesy of Val Stones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: There was Lee [Banfield], Kate, myself, and you. I could spot this very tall young man and I thought, &lt;em&gt;He's bound to get in&lt;/em&gt;. I said to Lee, "If you and I get in, we're the two old ones and he's going to be the young one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi:&lt;/strong&gt; I'll pay you later, Val. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: So you come in and they have you do a technical challenge the way it would be in the show?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly like that. They basically make it as real as possible, just to make sure that you can cope with the pressure, because it's not easy, baking in the tent. You’re doing your daytime job and you are having to write recipes and practice while being filmed at the same time, while competing with 11 other people who are equally as good as you. It gets really tough. But I think everyone who makes it on the show deserves to be on there, because they've worked their ass off. I don't know if I can say &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;:  You can, it's okay. That's one of the lower-tier ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. Lower-tier swear words. This is the thing I always tell people: It's one of the best shows, because you go on there, and you’re competing for a bunch of flowers and of course the cake stand. And of course huge opportunities after, because it opens a lot of doors for all the bakers. But everyone is very, very friendly and helping each other, and it doesn't actually feel like a competition. It ends up feeling like a group of friends, baking together in the same kitchen and just having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I remember I was doing my gingerbread [on the show], and it collapsed. I’m going “Ahhh!” and I think it was you who said, "I've got some glitter." You threw some glitter over to me and put icing sugar and glitter all over it and we just kept it going. And that's what bakers do. You shout out that you need a bowl or a whisk, and one of your baking friends will get it for you. You know those trenches in the war? It’s kind of like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: She's going war story on you now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;old. You do—you look after each other, you protect each other's backs, and it makes for a long-standing friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: I think a lot of Americans, myself included, really love the show because it seems so much friendlier than American reality shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I've heard that before. American reality shows, they'll literally stab you and push you under a bus at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: I don't know if you've seen American cooking shows, but there's actually one where the whole point is to sabotage the other chefs. It's called &lt;em&gt;Cutthroat Kitchen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="356" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Bakeoff3/99503134c.jpg" width="312"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Courtesy of Val Stones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val:&lt;/strong&gt; My sister lives in New York, so for the past 10 years I've been watching American cooking programs when I'm over there. They record them for me. I think what it is, is they offer large sums of money. We don't get offered any money. It's a bunch of flowers and the kudos of winning. If they put a hundred thousand pounds on it, you might start thinking, &lt;em&gt;Well, I'm not going to help him&lt;/em&gt;. And that doesn't happen on &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;, does it, Sel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Nah. Because there's no money, no one is stabbing each other. And if I'll be honest with you, if you did win a lump sum, I still don’t think it’d be like that, because—no offense to the Americans—but I think it's an English thing where we're nice. We like competition, but we're still polite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even still today, everyone’s very helpful when you're having some sort of breakdown or issue, anything. Everyone steps in. And Val is always the one who gives the experienced speech about—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm the grandma of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi:&lt;/strong&gt; It's always with words of wisdom, because you've lived it, so you know how it is. Everyone's from different backgrounds, and there are huge age gaps, but we all managed to get along because of one thing, and that's baking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: When we met for the first time at the hotel, that was the moment that you knew who the other bakers were. We had no idea who had been picked until folks started walking in the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you remember your first impressions of each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I was very late, so they're all thinking, &lt;em&gt;Who's this guy who is late? He's gonna be a problem&lt;/em&gt;. I turned up really late on my motorbike. I was soaking wet and I just smiled. I don't think I even apologized. I just said, “Hey, I'm here for the baking show.” And everyone looked at me like, &lt;em&gt;Who the hell is this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: You walked in in your gear and I remember thinking, &lt;em&gt;Ah, it's that young man that I saw&lt;/em&gt;. And I realized, &lt;em&gt;Gosh, he's gonna be real trouble, that one&lt;/em&gt;. But I was so pleased to see you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: What was the vibe like on set? Was there time for hanging out and getting to know one another, or was it all stress all the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;:  There was always time. From day one, that's when the friendship began. It’s two days of baking, so we arrive on the evening before the first day and then we all catch up on what's been going on in the week. When we arrived at the hotel, we all had dinner together, we just got to know each other. And then on the first day of baking we wake up, we get ready, we get on the same bus. No one's quiet or got their game face on. If anything, we're quite playful and loud—like schoolkids going on a field trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then we go in the tent and we bake and then after we bake the challenge, we go into a green room and we catch up there. We sing, we eat, and then we go back in. So there's always time. Even during competitions, we used to just chat and sometimes get told off for being too playful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: By who? The producer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: The tent police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were up at 5 o’clock, on the bus at 6 o’clock, on the set at 7 o’clock checking your ingredients, and we would bake often till half past 9 o’clock at night. We were never allowed out of sight of anyone. We were either in the tent or in the green room, for nine to 12 hours a day. You're very close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is stressful. We used to have downtime, playing stupid games. Each week we'd bring board games. We would do karaoke. You name it, we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: It was a good thing no one brought Monopoly, because that would have ruined the entire friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val:&lt;/strong&gt; I did something on my last day. We were running out of ideas, so I brought my shopping list from 1972, and I had people guessing how much things cost in 1972. It wasn't very entertaining, but it passes the time a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: We have a video, which obviously we're not showing anyone, of our karaoke sessions and our amazing voices. What was the song—Bon Jovi, “Always.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: You were singing to a vase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck: &lt;/strong&gt;Val, do you have a go-to karaoke song too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I do like cheering, but everybody knows I'm busted out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you remember how you two, specifically, became friends?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: During downtime or when we were at the hotel I used to talk to Val a lot, and in the green room. I think our common interests came into play, because I found out that Val loved motorbikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I had a motorbike license before Selasi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I think that's when the friendship really began. Also because I love whiskey—Val brought me two tiny bottles of whiskey from a distillery onto the set for me, which I still haven't drank. They're still at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I've got some more samples for you, but you're gonna have to come over here to drink them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, people don't know, but I had an accident about seven or eight months before I entered &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt; and I broke both sides of my body. I find it really hard carrying heavy things, and Selasi was always there— "Come on, I'll carry your bags." I felt, &lt;em&gt;My goodness, he's been brought up properly. He's a nice young man&lt;/em&gt;. What do you call me, Selasi?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite OAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: What is OAP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Old Age Pensioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: A person who is past 60 and getting retirement pension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: That's the term in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm his favorite OAP. And I've always said that Selasi is my favorite adopted son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also we've got the same stupid sense of humor. I can say things and I know Selasi won't take offense, and vice versa. But he watches his swearing with me, just like he would his grandma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: It's not my fault. I work in a bank, so we're used to shouting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember one thing Val did for the friendship was, because she knew I'm basically addicted to—it's not weed or cocaine, so don't worry—it's Haribo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: Candy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, the gummy bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I've got a major addiction to them. So during one of the filmings, Val brought me a massive box-load of Haribos. And she just won me over at that point. I'm keeping you forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I come over to America twice a year, and I always bring back some different Haribos that I might find on my travels. I've limited it a little bit because we're concerned it's not gonna do you good, having all this sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: No, my dentist is gonna kill me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: After the season wrapped up filming and you guys went home, how did your friendship progress after that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: We have a very strong WhatsApp group, so we continued to chat. I've got this kind of mothering instinct for all the bakers, but particularly for Selasi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Because I'm the troublesome one, that's why. She wants to make sure I'm behaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="left"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="277" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Bakeoff1/e42fba70e.jpg" width="417"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Courtesy of Val Stones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I often think about Selasi and worry about him. I watch how the banks are going and I'll email him and say, “Are you all right? Your bank's not closing?” And when you did your patisserie course, I was really proud that you worked so hard for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I spent eight months this year in Switzerland just studying patisserie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val: &lt;/strong&gt;I kept looking at photographs that Selasi put on Instagram and thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh, that's going to be really bad, he’s leaning over&lt;/em&gt;. I'll be reminding Selasi to stand properly and stretch out his back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;:  Val is really good about making sure I'm okay and that everyone else is okay and just updating us on what she's up to. She’s very busy. She's nonstop. We have to make sure that she's not overworking herself, because at the end of the day she's retired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: They all treat me like the aged grandma. I'm, like, 22 in the head and 68 in the body. I've always been active. I would never retire as such. So I still teach. I do baking classes and I work for a company that sells houses. And we do food festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: I know you guys are kind of far apart geographically, but do you ever visit each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, it may be difficult this year because it was a very intensive course, wasn't it, Selasi? You didn't have much time to come home. Last year we met twice. And we all did Candice [Brown]’s wedding in the summer, in France, who won [our season of &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;]. Selasi, because he was already in Europe, came on his motorbike. You made chocolates, and we all made wedding cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: You all made wedding cakes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Bakeoff5/14f61c4de.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Selasi and Val (left) at the wedding of their fellow contestant. Courtesy of Val Stones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: That's a lot of wedding cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: She had 11 wedding cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn't do a wedding cake, because I was coming on the motorbike. Logistically, it wouldn't work. So I made chocolate pralines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: They were delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: And then Val, she has this habit, bless her—if you want one thing, Val will give you four. She's always giving, giving, giving—that's the nature of Val. I think you made little cakes, and then what was the big one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I used Candice's grandma's Christmas-cake recipe. I said, “Your grandma is with you, because I've made her cake.” And I modeled a bride-and-groom pug dog for the top. We all stayed in one house, all the bakers. They were consoling me because the cakes traveled in the hold of the airplane and when I unwrapped them they were a little bit battered. Everyone said, “No, no, no, come on, we can do this.” And it was just like being back in the tent again: everybody helping each other. We are like a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had to squish up, double up in some of the rooms, but it was brilliant. We're thinking about maybe doing it again this year. It's hard to plan. But we try really hard. And I know I've always got a bed in your spare room, Selasi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="378" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/friendshipfiles_cakes/45589f60e.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Selasi’s chocolates (left) and Val’s cake (right.) Courtesy of Val Stones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: I need to cut you a key, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Selasi, do you have other friends who are Val's age, and Val, do you have other friends who are Selasi's age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: No, actually. I was gonna say some of my work colleagues, but I don't really talk to them outside of work as I do with Val.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: Because I work as a teacher, I'm about young people all the time, which is lovely. Most of the people I work with are in their 30s. I tend to just enjoy the company of younger people. It keeps you young. It really does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck&lt;/strong&gt;: It seems like it's pretty rare these days, to have close relationships with people of another generation outside of your family. What do you think your friendship has brought to your lives that you don't get from your other friendships with people your own age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi&lt;/strong&gt;: Most of the time it’s the voice of reason. Because when you're young, you can fall into a trap thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh, nothing's going to work for me&lt;/em&gt;. But when you have someone like Val who's lived in a different generation—she knows life's basically repeating itself. What happened to our parents is gonna happen to us is gonna happen to our kids. Having Val, I see a different side of things, because her life experience is also different from my parents’ life experience or my grandma's life experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: There are things that you might not want to tell your mum that you could tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selasi:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not a replacement mom, and it's not an Oedipus thing, nothing like that. Honestly. There's a saying that if you want to ask somebody a question, ask the person with the grayest hair, because they will probably give you a proper answer. I always say to all the bakers, there isn't much I haven't experienced, so I'm always here for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I like Selasi is: being around young people—listening to them, knowing what makes them tick—gives you an insight into the beat of life now. It stops me getting older far before I need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know should be featured on The Friendship Files, get in touch at &lt;a href="mailto:friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com"&gt;friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com&lt;/a&gt;, and tell us a bit about what makes the friendship unique.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/uqyc3QuJjts" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Julie Beck</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/julie-beck/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/01/Tang_Atlantic_BakeOff/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Wenjia Tang / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">A Friendship Baked in the &lt;em&gt;Great British Bake Off &lt;/em&gt;Tent</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/uqyc3QuJjts/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T10:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T17:01:30-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-581578</id><summary type="html">“You need a bowl or a whisk, and one of your baking friends will get it for you.

&lt;h3&gt;The Friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Mike Oliveira, a.k.a. "Mr. O,"&lt;/span&gt; 42, a history teacher at Interlake High School, in Bellevue, Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Jasmine Sun&lt;/span&gt;, 19, a sophomore at Stanford University, major undeclared&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Jessica Dai&lt;/span&gt;, 19, a sophomore at Brown University, studying computer science&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Cayla Lee,&lt;/span&gt; 20, a sophomore at Harvard University, studying social studies and math&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Christina Li&lt;/span&gt;, 20, a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon, studying finance and decision science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; For the students: How long have you all been friends, and how did you meet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine Sun:&lt;/strong&gt; Our high school has a competitive debate team, and all four of us joined as freshmen. We were the only four people in our year who stuck it out through the whole year. And when you're stuck with the same three other people for hours and hours on end, you have to like each other, or else you would quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Dai:&lt;/strong&gt; People called us “the debate girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; My high-school community was pretty apolitical, and debate was one of the communities where we learned about a lot of things. Bellevue's kind of a suburb, and it's pretty privileged and homogenous. At least our classrooms felt like it. So we'd challenge each other to do our best to think about things that weren't in our immediate vicinities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you meet Mr. O? (Should I call you Mike or Mr. O?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Oliveira:&lt;/strong&gt; It's funny, everybody calls me O; my students call me Mr. O. So Jasmine, I met her during her freshman year, on the tennis team, because I coached tennis. And then the other three young ladies I met in class when they were in their sophomore year—an International Baccalaureate class in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we started talking by going to his tutorial, which is a half hour after school where students can ask questions about homework. I'm not sure if any of us asked questions about homework, though. 'Cause he's really scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla Lee: &lt;/strong&gt;I can confirm that Mr. O was really scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; How so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; I've been wanting to know this for years. How so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; As little 15-year-olds, it's easy to get intimidated. Mr. O has a very sarcastic sense of humor, and he yells a lot in class, but, like, in a funny way. But I think it scares a lot of kids off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="left"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="447" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Teacher2/db8b0fde8.jpg" width="332"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;From left to right: Mr. O, Jessica Dai, Jasmine Sun. Courtesy of Jasmine Sun.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Mr. O, were you the debate adviser as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; No. I have nothing to do with debate. Debate would use my room at the end of the day, so I think because I was in here, they would show up a little early, and conversation started that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina Li:&lt;/strong&gt; Once we became more familiar with O, the four of us began joining him for lunch, or dropping in during lunch hour to tell him about our day, or ask about his day, and share whatever was going on in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you talk about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina:&lt;/strong&gt; I think as teenagers, we all complained a lot, and we would always go to O to detail our daily trivial matters, and ask him for advice. O would listen to us, but his very sarcastic humor usually put everything into perspective. He’d be very realistic and make sure that we weren't too caught up in our everyday troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; I always felt like my job was just to listen. One of the things that has always been cool to me about the friendship is that they come from a totally different mind-set and background than what I have. And to see a window into their lives was cool. The topics you guys you were doing for debate led into more political conversations that weren't tied to class, which I think is where things moved away from just a normal teacher-student kind of relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; O told us that his goal through teaching U.S.-history classes was to plant the seeds of awareness of inequality—racial inequality, social inequality. Stuff like looking at maps of, say, black migration after Reconstruction. Or looking at maps of segregation within our own city. And he wouldn't say “Oh, you should believe X or Y.” But by giving us that information, he planted the seeds for people later in life, maybe even years later, to have a realization, like: &lt;em&gt;Oh my God. I suddenly understand all of these things&lt;/em&gt;. That was really important to my own understanding of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; What Jasmine said about Mr. O’s history style parallels the way he talks with us, because he doesn't really impose value judgments on how we feel or what we're going through, but just always provides perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; I will say, there was a lot of value in our everyday complaining. Because the four of us come from pretty similar backgrounds. Not exactly the same, obviously, but all of our parents emigrated to the U.S. from different places in Asia. And there's a lot of pressure to go into certain careers, to achieve certain amounts, some of which aligns with stereotypes. It was cathartic to talk to each other, but oftentimes that would make us more stressed out, because we were all stressed about the same thing, with the same kind of familial pressures. It was just very grounding to talk to O. Because rather than letting that energy fester within ourselves and within our communities, we were able to gain some perspective that came from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; I agree. I feel like Mr. O was my first adult friend. It's hard to have adult friends when you're a high schooler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; So you guys kept eating lunch together the rest of your time in high school?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, the cafeteria was crowded and dirty. So I think we just started coming to O's room. I don't even know if we asked permission. Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; How did your friendship evolve over the rest of high school, and after you guys graduated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina:&lt;/strong&gt; I think especially senior year, we got to see more into his life. For example, hearing the thoughts that are running through his head as he's teaching day-to-day. He would ask questions like “What does the student think when I say this?” And when O was expecting his first baby, he told us, and that was really special to me. That was a very defining moment in which I realized, &lt;em&gt;Hopefully we provided as much value to O as he has to us&lt;/em&gt;. It made me realize, also, that this friendship was something that would last a lot longer than just my high-school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; My daughter was born two years ago. It was a very difficult process for my wife. The girls didn't know that I was going through all these baby issues, wondering, &lt;em&gt;Will my daughter be healthy?&lt;/em&gt; and all these kinds of things. So having them come in was always this super wonderful distraction from that part of my life. It was one of those situations where we didn't tell a whole lot of people about the upcoming birth, because we weren't sure which way it would go. It wasn't until a week or so before my daughter was born that I announced it at school to the kids. And I made an announcement to the ladies first, before I made it to the other students. But it was really impactful to have those conversations with them, knowing that I had this dark haze in the background. It also put things into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; How so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; During the things that we were going through with my daughter, the terror and the fear of that, I had the hope of, if this thing does work out&lt;a&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;  I kept thinking these would be great, strong young female role models for Addison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla, Christina, Jasmine, Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; Aww!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O: &lt;/strong&gt;Now it got weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you introduced the girls to your family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; They've met Addison, my daughter, a couple of times. We've gone to the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; It was on Mercer Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; I live in Seattle, in the city, and the girls live in the suburbs. So we met in between the two. That was fun, to see them interact with her. I've always been very shocked as to how much they've cared about Addison. So I've always sent pictures, and Jasmine created a Facebook group for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; I had a folder in my email with the label “Addison Pictures” because we've gotten so many of them. That’s why Jasmine made the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you describe what the Facebook group is, and when that started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; Mr. O used to always call us the Goof Troop, because we would roll in with our goofy problems, I guess. And you're not allowed to friend teachers on Facebook until you graduate probably, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt;  It was toward the end of the senior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; Eventually he let us add him on Facebook. Because we had these super long email chains with baby pictures in them, and I wanted a way to keep in consistent contact. All four of us were going to different schools, and none of us were in the area, and our breaks would never align. So I just made a Facebook group called “The Goof Troop” or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you remember why you started calling them the Goof Troop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="168" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/gooftroop7_crop/39e6e2ee6.png" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Courtesy of Jasmine Sun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; So the Goof Troop is—I don't know if you guys even know this—it's from an old cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn't know that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, with Goofy, like Mickey Mouse Goofy. And he had this little kids' show called &lt;em&gt;The Goof Troop. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; In the Facebook group, O posts a lot of baby videos that we like, because we're stressed out still, and they make you feel better. And then also sometimes we'll add questions. Like if we go to an interesting talk, we'll post that and be like, "What do you think?" Or whenever we visit, that's how we coordinate a meet-up. It's nice, because when your life is chaotic, it’s easy to forget little happy things, like Addison is walking, Addison is talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also I remember before he announced he was having a baby, we had this theory. We were like, “O is softer this year, and we don't know why.” He’s usually very sarcastic and gruff. And why would he be nicer to these kids than he was to us? Then he sent us this email that was like, "Come to my room during lunch. It's important.” And then everything made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; I remember discussing the email and what it could possibly mean. And we predicted that he had a baby. He was very sentimental around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow, very intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; He doesn't like to be seen as sentimental. It's not his personal brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Is that true, Mr. O? What is your personal brand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn't realize I had a personal brand. I'm face-palming and laughing, because I hadn't heard the backstory on this. But I probably was much different at that moment in time, and so it makes sense that they were like, “What the hell is going on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any other standout memories you have of how your relationship became a more outside-of-school friendship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina:&lt;/strong&gt; This touches on the more intercultural interactions that we have: One of the first few breaks when I came back home from Pittsburgh, where I go to school, there was this new Asian bakery that had just opened up. And I had told O before about this Chinese cake, this kind of dough with filling inside, and he had no idea what I was talking about. And when I visited that day for break, I was very insistent on getting this cake with a small filling in it and bringing it to O, and showing him what it was and making him eat it. I was so excited to have him try it and see a part of my culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; Also, I remember in maybe junior year—do you know what bubble tea is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="495" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/02/Teacher1/8b123e862.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;From left to right: Jasmine, Christina, Jessica, Cayla. Courtesy of Jasmine Sun.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; O had never heard of what it was. We were trying to describe it to him, and he just didn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; We went to the bubble-tea store, and we were trying to think what drink we should put the boba in. We were thinking, what is the whitest thing we could get? So we ended up putting boba in a smoothie or something, so that it would be more palatable to him. But it actually backfired, because Mr. Oliveira doesn't like sweet things. So we would have been much better off just getting him a jasmine tea or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; Mr. O, do you like bubble tea now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O: &lt;/strong&gt;As Cayla said, the one they got me was unbelievably sweet. So I did not prefer that version, that's for sure. I do enjoy it, but that one was unbelievably sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; We were trying to be culturally sensitive. We were like, “Should we get taro?” because we like taro. But then we were like, “White people don't like taro.” Our cultural-sensitivity practices have improved, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beck:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the value of an intergenerational friendship like this? What has it added to your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cayla:&lt;/strong&gt; I felt this after my first semester of college when I came back and visited Mr. Oliveira: I had changed so much as a result of being away in a completely unfamiliar environment. Coming back and reflecting on the semester with him was valuable to me, because he has seen me grow throughout the years. We really did talk to him about things that probably our parents don't even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina:&lt;/strong&gt; I enjoy psychology and thinking about how generations are changing. It’s always interesting to talk to him about his life, and then talk about my life&lt;strike&gt; &lt;/strike&gt;and talk about Addison's life. Those three very different generations are something that I enjoy reflecting on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; I think our friendship has allowed me to keep my stressors and concerns in perspective. Especially in thinking about what kinds of decisions I make about my life going forward, and how I visualize what my life looks like in 20, 30 years. Having someone like O there is an interesting way for me to process my thoughts, and think about what really matters to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine:&lt;/strong&gt; Our first normal exposure to adults is parents. Parents are there to guide you in a more direct sense—it's their job. They'll have opinions on what you should do. O has opinions, I'm sure, but because he's so nonjudgmental, it is that approach of letting us figure things out but also planting seeds of guidance. And that nonjudgmental but still older advisory perspective is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. O:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting to know them, it's helped me massively in my own teaching. I actually wish that y'all could be in my class now, and see how it has changed. Because I've been able to better understand your generation. In class today, we were looking at the difference between the generation of Martin Luther King Jr. and their tactics for civil rights, and how that has evolved with Black Lives Matter, and the tactics that they're using. It’s cool to see the next generation and how they push things. As a teacher, yes, I teach content, but that's the stuff that I care very little about. It's more about being able to create these relationships to help them tackle whatever's going to be out there in their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know should be featured on The Friendship Files, get in touch at &lt;a href="mailto:friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com"&gt;friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com&lt;/a&gt;, and tell us a bit about what makes the friendship unique.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/W-zlzXTvkiQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Julie Beck</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/julie-beck/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/02/Tang_Atlantic_TeacherStudentFinal_1/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Wenjia Tang / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">When a Teacher Becomes a Friend</title><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/W-zlzXTvkiQ/" rel="alternate" /><published>2019-02-15T10:01:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T16:59:35-05:00</updated><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-582430</id><summary type="html">"I think we just started coming to Mr. O's room for lunch.
